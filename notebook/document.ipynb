Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2\\nBackground\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3\\nModel Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder:\\nThe decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2\\nAttention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V\\n(1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof\\n1\\n√dk . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3\\nApplications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3\\nPosition-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2\\n(2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4\\nEmbeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nPE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4\\nWhy Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6'),\n",

To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5\\nTraining\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1\\nTraining Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2\\nHardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3\\nOptimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5)\\n(3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4\\nRegularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7'),\n",

Designing faster algorithms for SSSP is one of the most fundamental problems in graph theory, with\\nexciting improvements since the 50s.\\nThe textbook Dijkstra’s algorithm [Dij59], combined with advanced data structures such as the Fibonacci\\nheap [FT87] or the relaxed heap [DGST88], solves SSSP in O(m+n log n) time. It works in the comparison-\\naddition model, natural for real-number inputs, where only comparison and addition operations on edge\\nweights are allowed, and each operation consumes unit time. For undirected graphs, Pettie and Ramachan-\\ndran [PR05] proposed a hierarchy-based algorithm which runs in O(mα(m, n)+min{n log n, n log log r})\\ntime in the comparison-addition model, where α is the inverse-Ackermann function and r bounds the ratio\\nbetween any two edge weights.\\nDijkstra’s algorithm also produces an ordering of vertices by distances from the source as a byproduct.\\nA recent contribution by Haeupler, Hladík, Rozhoň, Tarjan and Tětek [HHR+24] showed that Dijkstra’s\\nalgorithm is optimal if we require the algorithm to output the order of vertices by distances.

It typically sorts vertices by their\\ndistances from the source, resulting in a time complexity of at least Θ(n log n).\\n• Bellman-Ford algorithm [Bel58]: based on dynamic programming, it relaxes all edges for several\\nsteps. For finding shortest paths with at most k edges, the Bellman-Ford algorithm can achieve this in\\nO(mk) time without requiring sorting.\\nOur approach merges these two methods through a recursive partitioning technique, similar to those used in\\nbottleneck path algorithms as described in [GT88, CKT+16, DLWX18].\\nAt any point during the execution of the Dijkstra’s algorithm, the priority queue (heap) maintains a “fron-\\ntier” S of vertices such that if a vertex u is “incomplete” — if the current distance estimate bd[u] is still greater\\nthan the true distance d(u) — the shortest s-u path must visit some complete vertex v ∈S. In this case, we\\nsay u is “dependent” on v ∈S. (However, vertices in S are not guaranteed to be all complete.) The Dijkstra’s\\nalgorithm simply picks the vertex in S closest to source, which must be complete, and then relaxes all edges\\nfrom that vertex.\\nThe running time bottleneck comes from the fact that sometimes the frontier may contain Θ(n) vertices.\\nSince we constantly need to pick the vertex closest to source, we essentially need to maintain a total order\\nbetween a large number of vertices, and are thus unable to break the Ω(n log n) sorting barrier. Our most\\nessential idea is a way to reduce the size of the frontier. Suppose we want to compute all distances that are\\nless than some upper bound B. Let eU be the set of vertices u with d(u) < B and the shortest s-u path visits\\na vertex in S. It is possible to limit the size of our frontier |S| to |eU|/ logΩ(1)(n), or 1/ logΩ(1)(n) of the\\nvertices of interest. Given a parameter k = logΩ(1)(n), there are two possible cases:\\n• If |eU| > k|S|, then our frontier already has size |eU|/k;\\n• Otherwise, suppose |eU| ≤k|S|. By running Bellman-Ford step k times from vertices in S, every\\nvertex u ∈eU whose shortest s-u path containing < k vertices in eU is complete. Otherwise the vertex\\nv ∈S which u is dependent on must have a shortest path tree rooted at it with ≥k vertices in eU, so\\nwe can shrink the frontier S to the set of “pivots”, each of which has a shortest path tree of size ≥k,\\nand the number of such pivots is bounded by |eU|/k.\\nOur algorithm is based on the idea above, but instead of using a Dijkstra-like method where the frontier\\nis dynamic and thus intractable, we use a divide-and-conquer procedure that consists of log n/t levels, each\\ncontaining a set of frontier vertices and an upper bound B, such that a naive implementation would still spend\\nΘ(t) time per frontier vertex and the running time would remain Θ(log n) per vertex. We can however apply\\nthe aforementioned frontier reduction on each level so that the Θ(t) work only applies to the pivots, about\\n1/ logΩ(1)(n) of the frontier vertices. Thus the running time per vertex gets reduced to log n/ logΩ(1)(n),\\nwhich is a significant speedup.\\n1.2\\nRelated Works\\nFor the SSSP problem, if we allow the algorithm to run in the word RAM model with integer edge weights, a\\nsequence of improvements beyond O(n log n) [FW93, FW94, Tho00a, Ram96, Ram97, Tho00b, Hag00] cul-\\nminated in Thorup’s linear-time algorithm for undirected graphs [Tho99] and O(m + n log log min{n, C})\\n2'),\n",

Let n = |V |, m = |E| be the number of vertices and edges in the graph. In\\nthe single-source shortest path problem, we assume there is a source vertex in the graph denoted by s. The\\ngoal of our algorithm is to find the length of shortest path from s to every vertex v ∈V , denoted by d(v).\\nWithout loss of generality, we assume that every vertex in G is reachable from s, so m ≥n −1.\\nConstant-Degree Graph.\\nIn this paper we assume that the algorithm works on a graph with constant in-\\ndegrees and out-degrees. For any given graph G we may construct G′ by a classical transformation (similar\\nto [Fre83]) to accomplish this:\\n• Substitute each vertex v with a cycle of vertices strongly connected with zero-weight edges. For every\\nincoming or outgoing neighbor w of v, there is a vertex xvw on this cycle.\\n• For every edge (u, v) in G, add a directed edge from vertex xuv to xvu with weight wuv.\\nIt’s clear that the shortest path is preserved by the transformation. Each vertex in G′ has in-degree and\\nout-degree at most 2, while G′ being a graph with O(m) vertices and O(m) edges.\\nComparison-Addition Model.\\nOur algorithm works under the comparison-addition model, where all edge\\nweights are subject to only comparison and addition operations. In this model, each addition and comparison\\ntakes unit time, and no other computations on edge weights are allowed.\\nLabels Used in the Algorithm.\\nFor a vertex v ∈V , denote d(u) as the length of shortest path from s to u\\nin the graph. Similar to the Dijkstra’s algorithm, our algorithm maintains a global variable bd[u] as a sound\\nestimation of d(u) (that is, bd[u] ≥d(u)). Initially bd[s] = 0 and bd[v] = ∞for any other v ∈V . Throughout\\nthe algorithm we only update bd[v] in a non-increasing manner by relaxing an edge (u, v) ∈E, that is, assign\\nbd[v] ←bd[u] + wuv when bd[u] + wuv is no greater than the old value of bd[v]. Therefore each possible value\\nof bd[v] corresponds to a path from s to v. If bd[x] = d(x), we say x is complete; otherwise, we say x is\\nincomplete. If all vertices in a set S are complete, we say S is complete. Note that completeness is sensitive\\nto the progress of the algorithm. The algorithm also maintains a shortest path tree according to current bd[·]\\nby recording the predecessor Pred[v] of each vertex v. When relaxing an edge (u, v), we set Pred[v] ←u.\\n3'),\n",

All paths we obtain in this algorithm have different lengths.\\nThis assumption is required for two purposes:\\n1. To ensure that Pred[v] for all vertices v ∈V keep a tree structure throughout the algorithm;\\n2. To provide a relative order of vertices with the same value of bd[].\\nNext, we show that this assumption does not lose generality since we can provide a total order for all\\npaths we obtain. We treat each path of length l that traverses α vertices v1 = s, v2, ..., vα as a tuple\\n⟨l, α, vα, vα−1, ..., v1⟩(note that the sequence of vertices is reversed in the tuple). We sort paths in the\\nlexicographical order of the tuple in principle. That is, first compare the length l. When we have a tie, com-\\npare α. If there is still a tie, compare the sequence of vertices from vα to v1. Comparison between the tuples\\ncan be done in only O(1) time with extra information of Pred[] and α stored for each bd[v]:\\nRelaxing an edge (u, v): If u ̸= Pred[v], even if there is a tie in l and α, it suffices to compare between\\nu and Pred[v], and if u = Pred[v], then bd[u] is updated to currently “shortest” and bd[v] needs to get\\nupdated;\\nComparing two different bd[u] and bd[v] for u ̸= v: Even if there is a tie in l and α, it suffices to compare\\nthe endpoints u and v only.\\nTherefore, in the following sections, we may assume that each path started from s has a unique length.\\n3\\nThe Main Result\\n3.1\\nThe Algorithm\\nRecall that we work on SSSP from source s in constant-degree graphs with m = O(n). Let k := ⌊log1/3(n)⌋\\nand t := ⌊log2/3(n)⌋be two parameters in our algorithm. Our main idea is based on divide-and-conquer\\non vertex sets. We hope to partition a vertex set U into 2t pieces U = U1 ∪U2 · · · ∪U2t of similar sizes,\\nwhere vertices in earlier pieces have smaller distances, and then recursively partition each Ui. In this way, the\\nsize of the sub-problem shrinks to a single vertex after roughly (log n)/t recursion levels. To construct our\\nstructure dynamically, each time we would try to compute the distances to a set of closest vertices (without\\nnecessarily recovering a complete ordering between their true distances), and report a boundary indicating\\nhow much progress we actually make.\\nSuppose at some stage of the algorithm, for every u with d(u) < b, u is complete and we have relaxed all\\nthe edges from u. We want to find the true distances to vertices v with d(v) ≥b. To avoid the Θ(log n) time\\nper vertex in a priority queue, consider the “frontier” S containing all current vertices v with b ≤bd[v] < B\\nfor some bound B (without sorting them). We can see that the shortest path to every incomplete vertex v′\\nwith b ≤d(v′) < B must visit some complete vertex in S. Thus to compute the true distance to every v′\\nwith b ≤d(v′) < B, it suffices to find the shortest paths from vertices in S and bounded by B. We call this\\nsubproblem bounded multi-source shortest path (BMSSP) and design an efficient algorithm to solve it. The\\nfollowing lemma summarizes what our BMSSP algorithm achieves.\\nLemma 3.1 (Bounded Multi-Source Shortest Path). We are given an integer level l ∈[0, ⌈log(n)/t⌉], a set\\nof vertices S of size ≤2lt, and an upper bound B > maxx∈S bd[x].

Note that all vertices visited by Algorithm 1 are in eU, and those in W are not guaranteed to be\\ncomplete after the procedure. Also note that every vertex in eU must visit some vertex in S which was\\ncomplete before Algorithm 1, since any incomplete vertex v at that time with d(v) < B must visit some\\ncomplete vertex in S.\\nIf the algorithm returns due to |W| > k|S|, we still have |W| = O(k|S|) since the out-degrees of vertices\\nare constant. For every incomplete vertex v such that d(v) < B, we know that the shortest path to v visits\\nsome complete vertex u ∈S. Since P = S, we must also have u ∈P and conditions in the lemma are thus\\nsatisfied.\\nIf |W| ≤k|S|, P is derived from F. For any vertex x ∈eU, consider the first vertex y ∈S on the shortest\\npath to x which was complete before Algorithm 1, then y must be a root of a tree in F. If there are no more\\nthan k −1 edges from y to x on the path, x is complete and added to W after k relaxations. Otherwise, the\\ntree rooted at y contains at least k vertices, therefore y is added to P. Additionally, |P| ≤|W|/k ≤|eU|/k\\nsince each vertex in P covers a unique subtree of size at least k in F.\\nTo evaluate the time complexity, note that the size of W is O(min{k|S|, |eU|}), so each iteration takes\\nO(min{k|S|, |eU|}) time. Computing P after the for-loop runs in O(|W|) time for final W. Therefore,\\nFindPivots finishes in O(min{k2|S|, k|eU|}) time.\\nWe also use the following data structure to help adaptively partition a problem into sub-problems, spec-\\nified in Lemma 3.3:\\nLemma 3.3.

Otherwise, x should satisfy max(S′) <\\nx ≤min(D) where D is the set of elements in the data structure after the pull operation.\\nProof. We introduce a block-based linked list data structure to support the required operations efficiently.\\nSpecifically, the data is organized into two sequences of blocks, D0 and D1. D0 only maintains elements\\nfrom batch prepends while D1 maintains elements from insert operations, so every single inserted element\\nis always inserted to D1. Each block is a linked list containing at most M key/value pairs. The number of\\nblocks in D1 is bounded by O(max{1, N/M}), while D0 does not have such a requirement. Blocks are\\nmaintained in the sorted order according to their values, that is, for any two key/value pairs ⟨a1, b1⟩∈Bi\\nand ⟨a2, b2⟩∈Bj , where Bi and Bj are the i-th and j-th blocks from a block sequence, respectively, and\\ni < j, we have b1 ≤b2. For each block in D1, we maintain an upper bound for its elements, so that the upper\\nbound for a block is no more than any value in the next block. We adopt a self-balancing binary search tree\\n(e.g. Red-Black Tree [GS78]) to dynamically maintain these upper bounds, with O(max{1, log(N/M)})\\nsearch/update time.\\nFor cases where multiple pairs with the same key are added, we record the status of each key and the\\nassociated value. If the new pair has a smaller value, we first delete the old pair then insert the new one,\\nensuring that only the most advantageous pair is retained for each key.\\nFor the operations required in Lemma 3.3:\\nInitialize(M, B) Initialize D0 with an empty sequence and D1 with a single empty block with upper bound\\nB. Set the parameter M.\\nDelete(a, b) To delete the key/value pair ⟨a, b⟩, we remove it directly from the linked list, which can be\\ndone in O(1) time. Note that it’s unnecessary to update the upper bounds of blocks after a deletion.\\nHowever, if a block in D1 becomes empty after deletion, we need to remove its upper bound in the\\nbinary search tree in O(max{1, log(N/M)}) time. Since Insert takes O(max{1, log(N/M)}) time\\nfor D1, deletion time will be amortized to insertion time with no extra cost.\\nInsert(a, b) To insert a key/value pair ⟨a, b⟩, we first check the existence of its key a. If a already exists, we\\ndelete original pair ⟨a, b′⟩and insert new pair ⟨a, b⟩only when b < b′.\\nThen we insert ⟨a, b⟩to D1. We first locate the appropriate block for it, which is the block with the\\nsmallest upper bound greater than or equal to b, using binary search (via the binary search tree) on\\nthe block sequence. ⟨a, b⟩is then added to the corresponding linked list in O(1) time. Given that the\\nnumber of blocks in D1 is O(max{1, N/M}), as we will establish later, the total time complexity for\\na single insertion is O(max{1, log(N/M)}).\\nAfter an insertion, the size of the block may increase, and if it exceeds the size limit M, a split operation\\nwill be triggered.\\nSplit When a block in D1 exceeds M elements, we perform a split. First, we identify the median element\\nwithin the block in O(M) time [BFP+73], partitioning the elements into two new blocks each with at\\nmost ⌈M/2⌉elements — elements smaller than the median are placed in the first block, while the rest\\nare placed in the second. This split ensures that each new block retains about ⌈M/2⌉elements while\\npreserving inter-block ordering, so the number of blocks in D1 is bounded by O(N/M). (Every block\\n7'),\n",

Due to the uniqueness of shortest paths, the shortest path tree T rooted at the source s can\\nbe constructed unambiguously. Define T(u) as the subtree rooted at u according to d(·). An immediate\\nobservation is that the shortest path to v passes through u if and only if v is in the subtree rooted at u.\\nFor a vertex set S, define T(S) = S\\nv∈S T(v), namely the union of the subtrees of T(s) rooted at vertices\\nin S, or equivalently, the set of vertices whose shortest paths pass through some vertex in S. For a set of\\nvertices S ⊆V , denote S∗= {v ∈S : v is complete}. Then T(S∗) = S\\nv∈S∗T(v) is the union of subtrees\\nof T(s) rooted at S∗, or the set of vertices whose shortest paths pass through some complete vertex in S.\\nObviously, T(S∗) ⊆T(S).

Another observation is that, a complete vertex would remain complete, so S∗and T(S∗) never lose\\na member.\\nFor a bound B, denote T<B(S) = {v ∈T(S) : d(v) < B}.

Then every incomplete\\nvertex v with d(v) < B is in T(X∗). Moreover, for any B′ < B, T<B′(S) = T<B′(X).\\nProof. For any incomplete vertex v with d(v) < B, as B < B, by definition, v ∈T(u) for some complete\\nvertex u ∈S. Therefore bd[u] = d(u) ≤d(v) < B, so u ∈X and thus v ∈T(X∗).\\nFor the second statement, it is clear that T<B′(X) ⊆T<B′(S). For any v ∈T<B′(S), since d(v) < B′ <\\nB < B, the shortest path to v passes through some vertex x ∈S∗. Now that bd[x] = d(x) ≤d(v) < B′, we\\nhave x ∈X and v ∈T<B′(X).\\nNow we are ready to prove the correctness part of Lemma 3.1.\\nLemma 3.7. We prove the correctness of Algorithm 3 by proving the following statement (the size of U is\\ndealt with in Lemma 3.9), restated from Lemma 3.1: Given a level l ∈[0, ⌈(log n)/t⌉], a bound B and a set\\nof vertices S of size ≤2lt, suppose that every incomplete vertex v with d(v) < B is in T(S∗).\\nThen, after running Algorithm 3, we have: U = T<B′(S) , and U is complete.\\nProof. We prove by induction on l. When l = 0, since S = {x} is a singleton, x must be complete. Then\\nclearly the classical Dijkstra’s algorithm (Algorithm 2) finds the desired U = T<B′(S) as required. Suppose\\ncorrectness holds for l−1, we prove that it holds for l. Denote Di as the set of vertices (keys) in D just before\\nthe i-th iteration (at the end of the (i −1)-th iteration), and D∗\\ni as the set of complete vertices in Di at that\\ntime. Next, we prove the following two propositions by induction on increasing order of i:\\nImmediately before the i-th iteration,\\n(a) Every incomplete vertex v with d(v) < B is in T[B′\\ni−1,B)(P).\\n(b) T[B′\\ni−1,B)(P) = T<B(Di) = T<B(D∗\\ni );\\nIn the base case i = 1, by Lemma 3.2, for every incomplete vertex v with d(v) < B (including v ∈P),\\nv ∈T<B(P ∗). Then d(v) ≥minx∈P ∗d(x) = minx∈P ∗bd[x] ≥B′\\n0. Thus every such v is in T[B′\\n0,B)(P)\\n(actually T<B′\\n0(P) is an empty set) and T[B′\\n0,B)(P) = T<B(P) = T<B(P ∗). Because D1 = P, the base\\ncase is proved.\\nSuppose both propositions hold for i. Then each incomplete vertex v with d(v) < B is in T[B′\\ni−1,B)(P) ⊆\\nT(D∗\\ni ). By Lemma 3.3, the suppositions of Lemma 3.6 are met for X := Si, Y := Di\\\\Si, and B := Bi, so\\nevery incomplete vertex v with d(v) < Bi is in T(Si∗); also note |Si| ≤2(l−1)t.

Note that vertices v of Si with bd[v] ≥B′\\ni are batch-\\nprepended back to Di+1 on Line 21, so we have bd[y] < B′\\ni. Thus y ∈Ui and is complete. For any vertex\\nx ∈T[B′\\ni,B)(y), as x ̸∈Ui, along the shortest path from y to x, there is an edge (u, v) with u ∈Ui and\\nv ̸∈Ui.

In-\\nserting P into D takes time C|P|t.

While typically task-agnostic\\nin architecture, this method still requires task-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of\\nthousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only\\na few examples or from simple instructions – something which current NLP systems still largely\\nstruggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic,\\nfew-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art ﬁne-\\ntuning approaches. Speciﬁcally, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion\\nparameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in\\nthe few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or ﬁne-tuning,\\nwith tasks and few-shot demonstrations speciﬁed purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3\\nachieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and\\ncloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-ﬂy reasoning or domain adaptation, such as\\nunscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same\\ntime, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3’s few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some\\ndatasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora.

First, single-layer representations were learned using word\\nvectors [MCCD13, PSM14] and fed to task-speciﬁc architectures, then RNNs with multiple layers of representations\\nand contextual state were used to form stronger representations [DL15, MBXS17, PNZtY18] (though still applied to\\ntask-speciﬁc architectures), and more recently pre-trained recurrent or transformer language models [VSP+17] have\\nbeen directly ﬁne-tuned, entirely removing the need for task-speciﬁc architectures [RNSS18, DCLT18, HR18].\\nThis last paradigm has led to substantial progress on many challenging NLP tasks such as reading comprehension,\\nquestion answering, textual entailment, and many others, and has continued to advance based on new architectures\\nand algorithms [RSR+19, LOG+19, YDY+19, LCG+19]. However, a major limitation to this approach is that while\\nthe architecture is task-agnostic, there is still a need for task-speciﬁc datasets and task-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning: to achieve\\nstrong performance on a desired task typically requires ﬁne-tuning on a dataset of thousands to hundreds of thousands\\nof examples speciﬁc to that task. Removing this limitation would be desirable, for several reasons.\\nFirst, from a practical perspective, the need for a large dataset of labeled examples for every new task limits the\\napplicability of language models. There exists a very wide range of possible useful language tasks, encompassing\\nanything from correcting grammar, to generating examples of an abstract concept, to critiquing a short story. For many\\nof these tasks it is difﬁcult to collect a large supervised training dataset, especially when the process must be repeated\\nfor every new task.\\nSecond, the potential to exploit spurious correlations in training data fundamentally grows with the expressiveness\\nof the model and the narrowness of the training distribution. This can create problems for the pre-training plus\\nﬁne-tuning paradigm, where models are designed to be large to absorb information during pre-training, but are then\\nﬁne-tuned on very narrow task distributions. For instance [HLW+20] observe that larger models do not necessarily\\ngeneralize better out-of-distribution. There is evidence that suggests that the generalization achieved under this paradigm\\ncan be poor because the model is overly speciﬁc to the training distribution and does not generalize well outside it\\n[YdC+19, MPL19]. Thus, the performance of ﬁne-tuned models on speciﬁc benchmarks, even when it is nominally at\\nhuman-level, may exaggerate actual performance on the underlying task [GSL+18, NK19].\\nThird, humans do not require large supervised datasets to learn most language tasks – a brief directive in natural\\nlanguage (e.g. “please tell me if this sentence describes something happy or something sad”) or at most a tiny number\\nof demonstrations (e.g. “here are two examples of people acting brave; please give a third example of bravery”) is often\\nFigure 1.1: Language model meta-learning. During unsupervised pre-training, a language model develops a broad\\nset of skills and pattern recognition abilities. It then uses these abilities at inference time to rapidly adapt to or recognize\\nthe desired task. We use the term “in-context learning” to describe the inner loop of this process, which occurs within\\nthe forward-pass upon each sequence. The sequences in this diagram are not intended to be representative of the data a\\nmodel would see during pre-training, but are intended to show that there are sometimes repeated sub-tasks embedded\\nwithin a single sequence.\\n3'),\n",

We show in-context learning\\nperformance on a simple task requiring the model to remove random symbols from a word, both with and without a\\nnatural language task description (see Sec. 3.9.2). The steeper “in-context learning curves” for large models demonstrate\\nimproved ability to learn a task from contextual information. We see qualitatively similar behavior across a wide range\\nof tasks.\\nsufﬁcient to enable a human to perform a new task to at least a reasonable degree of competence. Aside from pointing\\nto a conceptual limitation in our current NLP techniques, this adaptability has practical advantages – it allows humans\\nto seamlessly mix together or switch between many tasks and skills, for example performing addition during a lengthy\\ndialogue. To be broadly useful, we would someday like our NLP systems to have this same ﬂuidity and generality.\\nOne potential route towards addressing these issues is meta-learning1 – which in the context of language models means\\nthe model develops a broad set of skills and pattern recognition abilities at training time, and then uses those abilities\\nat inference time to rapidly adapt to or recognize the desired task (illustrated in Figure 1.1). Recent work [RWC+19]\\nattempts to do this via what we call “in-context learning”, using the text input of a pretrained language model as a form\\nof task speciﬁcation: the model is conditioned on a natural language instruction and/or a few demonstrations of the task\\nand is then expected to complete further instances of the task simply by predicting what comes next.\\nWhile it has shown some initial promise, this approach still achieves results far inferior to ﬁne-tuning – for example\\n[RWC+19] achieves only 4% on Natural Questions, and even its 55 F1 CoQa result is now more than 35 points behind\\nthe state of the art. Meta-learning clearly requires substantial improvement in order to be viable as a practical method of\\nsolving language tasks.\\nAnother recent trend in language modeling may offer a way forward. In recent years the capacity of transformer\\nlanguage models has increased substantially, from 100 million parameters [RNSS18], to 300 million parameters\\n[DCLT18], to 1.5 billion parameters [RWC+19], to 8 billion parameters [SPP+19], 11 billion parameters [RSR+19],\\nand ﬁnally 17 billion parameters [Tur20]. Each increase has brought improvements in text synthesis and/or downstream\\nNLP tasks, and there is evidence suggesting that log loss, which correlates well with many downstream tasks, follows a\\nsmooth trend of improvement with scale [KMH+20]. Since in-context learning involves absorbing many skills and\\ntasks within the parameters of the model, it is plausible that in-context learning abilities might show similarly strong\\ngains with scale.\\n1In the context of language models this has sometimes been called “zero-shot transfer”, but this term is potentially ambiguous:\\nthe method is “zero-shot” in the sense that no gradient updates are performed, but it often involves providing inference-time\\ndemonstrations to the model, so is not truly learning from zero examples. To avoid this confusion, we use the term “meta-learning”\\nto capture the inner-loop / outer-loop structure of the general method, and the term “in context-learning” to refer to the inner\\nloop of meta-learning. We further specialize the description to “zero-shot”, “one-shot”, or “few-shot” depending on how many\\ndemonstrations are provided at inference time. These terms are intended to remain agnostic on the question of whether the model\\nlearns new tasks from scratch at inference time or simply recognizes patterns seen during training – this is an important issue which\\nwe discuss later in the paper, but “meta-learning” is intended to encompass both possibilities, and simply describes the inner-outer\\nloop structure.\\n4'),\n",

See Figure 3.8 for a more detailed analysis on SuperGLUE, a standard NLP\\nbenchmark suite.\\nIn this paper, we test this hypothesis by training a 175 billion parameter autoregressive language model, which we call\\nGPT-3, and measuring its in-context learning abilities. Speciﬁcally, we evaluate GPT-3 on over two dozen NLP datasets,\\nas well as several novel tasks designed to test rapid adaptation to tasks unlikely to be directly contained in the training\\nset. For each task, we evaluate GPT-3 under 3 conditions: (a) “few-shot learning”, or in-context learning where we\\nallow as many demonstrations as will ﬁt into the model’s context window (typically 10 to 100), (b) “one-shot learning”,\\nwhere we allow only one demonstration, and (c) “zero-shot” learning, where no demonstrations are allowed and only\\nan instruction in natural language is given to the model. GPT-3 could also in principle be evaluated in the traditional\\nﬁne-tuning setting, but we leave this to future work.\\nFigure 1.2 illustrates the conditions we study, and shows few-shot learning of a simple task requiring the model to\\nremove extraneous symbols from a word. Model performance improves with the addition of a natural language task\\ndescription, and with the number of examples in the model’s context, K. Few-shot learning also improves dramatically\\nwith model size. Though the results in this case are particularly striking, the general trends with both model size and\\nnumber of examples in-context hold for most tasks we study. We emphasize that these “learning” curves involve no\\ngradient updates or ﬁne-tuning, just increasing numbers of demonstrations given as conditioning.\\nBroadly, on NLP tasks GPT-3 achieves promising results in the zero-shot and one-shot settings, and in the the few-shot\\nsetting is sometimes competitive with or even occasionally surpasses state-of-the-art (despite state-of-the-art being held\\nby ﬁne-tuned models). For example, GPT-3 achieves 81.5 F1 on CoQA in the zero-shot setting, 84.0 F1 on CoQA in\\nthe one-shot setting, 85.0 F1 in the few-shot setting. Similarly, GPT-3 achieves 64.3% accuracy on TriviaQA in the\\nzero-shot setting, 68.0% in the one-shot setting, and 71.2% in the few-shot setting, the last of which is state-of-the-art\\nrelative to ﬁne-tuned models operating in the same closed-book setting.\\nGPT-3 also displays one-shot and few-shot proﬁciency at tasks designed to test rapid adaption or on-the-ﬂy reasoning,\\nwhich include unscrambling words, performing arithmetic, and using novel words in a sentence after seeing them\\ndeﬁned only once. We also show that in the few-shot setting, GPT-3 can generate synthetic news articles which human\\nevaluators have difﬁculty distinguishing from human-generated articles.\\nAt the same time, we also ﬁnd some tasks on which few-shot performance struggles, even at the scale of GPT-3. This\\nincludes natural language inference tasks like the ANLI dataset, and some reading comprehension datasets like RACE\\nor QuAC. By presenting a broad characterization of GPT-3’s strengths and weaknesses, including these limitations, we\\nhope to stimulate study of few-shot learning in language models and draw attention to where progress is most needed.\\nA heuristic sense of the overall results can be seen in Figure 1.3, which aggregates the various tasks (though it should\\nnot be seen as a rigorous or meaningful benchmark in itself).\\n5'),\n",

Section 7 reviews related work and Section 8 concludes.\\n2\\nApproach\\nOur basic pre-training approach, including model, data, and training, is similar to the process described in [RWC+19],\\nwith relatively straightforward scaling up of the model size, dataset size and diversity, and length of training. Our use\\nof in-context learning is also similar to [RWC+19], but in this work we systematically explore different settings for\\nlearning within the context. Therefore, we start this section by explicitly deﬁning and contrasting the different settings\\nthat we will be evaluating GPT-3 on or could in principle evaluate GPT-3 on. These settings can be seen as lying on a\\nspectrum of how much task-speciﬁc data they tend to rely on. Speciﬁcally, we can identify at least four points on this\\nspectrum (see Figure 2.1 for an illustration):\\n• Fine-Tuning (FT) has been the most common approach in recent years, and involves updating the weights of\\na pre-trained model by training on a supervised dataset speciﬁc to the desired task. Typically thousands to\\nhundreds of thousands of labeled examples are used. The main advantage of ﬁne-tuning is strong performance\\non many benchmarks. The main disadvantages are the need for a new large dataset for every task, the potential\\nfor poor generalization out-of-distribution [MPL19], and the potential to exploit spurious features of the\\ntraining data [GSL+18, NK19], potentially resulting in an unfair comparison with human performance. In\\nthis work we do not ﬁne-tune GPT-3 because our focus is on task-agnostic performance, but GPT-3 can be\\nﬁne-tuned in principle and this is a promising direction for future work.\\n• Few-Shot (FS) is the term we will use in this work to refer to the setting where the model is given a few\\ndemonstrations of the task at inference time as conditioning [RWC+19], but no weight updates are allowed.\\nAs shown in Figure 2.1, for a typical dataset an example has a context and a desired completion (for example\\nan English sentence and the French translation), and few-shot works by giving K examples of context and\\ncompletion, and then one ﬁnal example of context, with the model expected to provide the completion. We\\ntypically set K in the range of 10 to 100 as this is how many examples can ﬁt in the model’s context window\\n(nctx = 2048). The main advantages of few-shot are a major reduction in the need for task-speciﬁc data and\\nreduced potential to learn an overly narrow distribution from a large but narrow ﬁne-tuning dataset. The main\\ndisadvantage is that results from this method have so far been much worse than state-of-the-art ﬁne-tuned\\nmodels. Also, a small amount of task speciﬁc data is still required. As indicated by the name, few-shot\\nlearning as described here for language models is related to few-shot learning as used in other contexts in\\nML [HYC01, VBL+16] – both involve learning based on a broad distribution of tasks (in this case implicit in\\nthe pre-training data) and then rapidly adapting to a new task.\\n• One-Shot (1S) is the same as few-shot except that only one demonstration is allowed, in addition to a natural\\nlanguage description of the task, as shown in Figure 1. The reason to distinguish one-shot from few-shot and\\nzero-shot (below) is that it most closely matches the way in which some tasks are communicated to humans.\\nFor example, when asking humans to generate a dataset on a human worker service (for example Mechanical\\nTurk), it is common to give one demonstration of the task. By contrast it is sometimes difﬁcult to communicate\\nthe content or format of a task if no examples are given.\\n6'),\n",

We typically present the model with a few dozen examples in the few shot setting. Exact phrasings for all task\\ndescriptions, examples and prompts can be found in Appendix G.\\n• Zero-Shot (0S) is the same as one-shot except that no demonstrations are allowed, and the model is only given\\na natural language instruction describing the task. This method provides maximum convenience, potential for\\nrobustness, and avoidance of spurious correlations (unless they occur very broadly across the large corpus of\\npre-training data), but is also the most challenging setting. In some cases it may even be difﬁcult for humans\\nto understand the format of the task without prior examples, so this setting is in some cases “unfairly hard”.\\nFor example, if someone is asked to “make a table of world records for the 200m dash”, this request can be\\nambiguous, as it may not be clear exactly what format the table should have or what should be included (and\\neven with careful clariﬁcation, understanding precisely what is desired can be difﬁcult). Nevertheless, for at\\nleast some settings zero-shot is closest to how humans perform tasks – for example, in the translation example\\nin Figure 2.1, a human would likely know what to do from just the text instruction.\\nFigure 2.1 shows the four methods using the example of translating English to French.

Here nparams is the total number of trainable parameters,\\nnlayers is the total number of layers, dmodel is the number of units in each bottleneck layer (we always have the\\nfeedforward layer four times the size of the bottleneck layer, dﬀ= 4 ∗dmodel), and dhead is the dimension of each\\nattention head. All models use a context window of nctx = 2048 tokens. We partition the model across GPUs along\\nboth the depth and width dimension in order to minimize data-transfer between nodes. The precise architectural\\nparameters for each model are chosen based on computational efﬁciency and load-balancing in the layout of models\\nacross GPU’s. Previous work [KMH+20] suggests that validation loss is not strongly sensitive to these parameters\\nwithin a reasonably broad range.\\n2.2\\nTraining Dataset\\nDatasets for language models have rapidly expanded, culminating in the Common Crawl dataset2 [RSR+19] constituting\\nnearly a trillion words. This size of dataset is sufﬁcient to train our largest models without ever updating on the same\\nsequence twice. However, we have found that unﬁltered or lightly ﬁltered versions of Common Crawl tend to have\\nlower quality than more curated datasets. Therefore, we took 3 steps to improve the average quality of our datasets:\\n(1) we downloaded and ﬁltered a version of CommonCrawl based on similarity to a range of high-quality reference\\ncorpora, (2) we performed fuzzy deduplication at the document level, within and across datasets, to prevent redundancy\\nand preserve the integrity of our held-out validation set as an accurate measure of overﬁtting, and (3) we also added\\nknown high-quality reference corpora to the training mix to augment CommonCrawl and increase its diversity.\\nDetails of the ﬁrst two points (processing of Common Crawl) are described in Appendix A. For the third, we added\\nseveral curated high-quality datasets, including an expanded version of the WebText dataset [RWC+19], collected\\nby scraping links over a longer period of time, and ﬁrst described in [KMH+20], two internet-based books corpora\\n(Books1 and Books2) and English-language Wikipedia.\\nTable 2.2 shows the ﬁnal mixture of datasets that we used in training. The CommonCrawl data was downloaded from\\n41 shards of monthly CommonCrawl covering 2016 to 2019, constituting 45TB of compressed plaintext before ﬁltering\\nand 570GB after ﬁltering, roughly equivalent to 400 billion byte-pair-encoded tokens. Note that during training, datasets\\nare not sampled in proportion to their size, but rather datasets we view as higher-quality are sampled more frequently,\\nsuch that CommonCrawl and Books2 datasets are sampled less than once during training, but the other datasets are\\nsampled 2-3 times. This essentially accepts a small amount of overﬁtting in exchange for higher quality training data.\\n2https://commoncrawl.org/the-data/\\n8'),\n",

Larger values of K are usually but not always better, so when a\\nseparate development and test set are available, we experiment with a few values of K on the development set and then\\nrun the best value on the test set. For some tasks (see Appendix G) we also use a natural language prompt in addition to\\n(or for K = 0, instead of) demonstrations.\\nOn tasks that involve choosing one correct completion from several options (multiple choice), we provide K examples\\nof context plus correct completion, followed by one example of context only, and compare the LM likelihood of\\neach completion. For most tasks we compare the per-token likelihood (to normalize for length), however on a small\\nnumber of datasets (ARC, OpenBookQA, and RACE) we gain additional beneﬁt as measured on the development set\\nby normalizing by the unconditional probability of each completion, by computing\\nP (completion|context)\\nP (completion|answer context), where\\nanswer context is the string \"Answer:\\n\" or \"A: \" and is used to prompt that the completion should be an answer\\nbut is otherwise generic.\\nOn tasks that involve binary classiﬁcation, we give the options more semantically meaningful names (e.g. “True” or\\n“False” rather than 0 or 1) and then treat the task like multiple choice; we also sometimes frame the task similar to what\\nis done by [RSR+19] (see Appendix G) for details.\\nOn tasks with free-form completion, we use beam search with the same parameters as [RSR+19]: a beam width of 4\\nand a length penalty of α = 0.6.

When the test set is private, our model is often too large to ﬁt on the test server, so we report results on\\nthe development set. We do submit to the test server on a small number of datasets (SuperGLUE, TriviaQA, PiQa)\\nwhere we were able to make submission work, and we submit only the 200B few-shot results, and report development\\nset results for everything else.\\n3\\nResults\\nIn Figure 3.1 we display training curves for the 8 models described in Section 2. For this graph we also include 6\\nadditional extra-small models with as few as 100,000 parameters. As observed in [KMH+20], language modeling\\nperformance follows a power-law when making efﬁcient use of training compute. After extending this trend by two\\nmore orders of magnitude, we observe only a slight (if any) departure from the power-law. One might worry that these\\nimprovements in cross-entropy loss come only from modeling spurious details of our training corpus. However, we will\\nsee in the following sections that improvements in cross-entropy loss lead to consistent performance gains across a\\nbroad spectrum of natural language tasks.\\nBelow, we evaluate the 8 models described in Section 2 (the 175 billion parameter parameter GPT-3 and 7 smaller\\nmodels) on a wide range of datasets. We group the datasets into 9 categories representing roughly similar tasks.\\nIn Section 3.1 we evaluate on traditional language modeling tasks and tasks that are similar to language modeling,\\nsuch as Cloze tasks and sentence/paragraph completion tasks. In Section 3.2 we evaluate on “closed book” question\\nanswering tasks: tasks which require using the information stored in the model’s parameters to answer general\\nknowledge questions. In Section 3.3 we evaluate the model’s ability to translate between languages (especially one-shot\\nand few-shot). In Section 3.4 we evaluate the model’s performance on Winograd Schema-like tasks. In Section 3.5 we\\nevaluate on datasets that involve commonsense reasoning or question answering. In Section 3.6 we evaluate on reading\\ncomprehension tasks, in Section 3.7 we evaluate on the SuperGLUE benchmark suite, and in 3.8 we brieﬂy explore\\nNLI. Finally, in Section 3.9, we invent some additional tasks designed especially to probe in-context learning abilities –\\nthese tasks focus on on-the-ﬂy reasoning, adaptation skills, or open-ended text synthesis.

This is still 4.1% lower than the ﬁne-tuned SOTA using a BERT based model [LDL19] but\\nimproves over previous zero-shot results by roughly 10%.\\n3.2\\nClosed Book Question Answering\\nIn this section we measure GPT-3’s ability to answer questions about broad factual knowledge. Due to the immense\\namount of possible queries, this task has normally been approached by using an information retrieval system to ﬁnd\\nrelevant text in combination with a model which learns to generate an answer given the question and the retrieved\\ntext. Since this setting allows a system to search for and condition on text which potentially contains the answer it\\nis denoted “open-book”. [RRS20] recently demonstrated that a large language model can perform surprisingly well\\ndirectly answering the questions without conditioning on auxilliary information. They denote this more restrictive\\nevaluation setting as “closed-book”. Their work suggests that even higher-capacity models could perform even better\\nand we test this hypothesis with GPT-3. We evaluate GPT-3 on the 3 datasets in [RRS20]: Natural Questions [KPR+19],\\nWebQuestions [BCFL13], and TriviaQA [JCWZ17], using the same splits. Note that in addition to all results being in\\nthe closed-book setting, our use of few-shot, one-shot, and zero-shot evaluations represent an even stricter setting than\\nprevious closed-book QA work: in addition to external content not being allowed, ﬁne-tuning on the Q&A dataset itself\\nis also not permitted.\\nThe results for GPT-3 are shown in Table 3.3. On TriviaQA, we achieve 64.3% in the zero-shot setting, 68.0% in the\\none-shot setting, and 71.2% in the few-shot setting. The zero-shot result already outperforms the ﬁne-tuned T5-11B by\\n14.2%, and also outperforms a version with Q&A tailored span prediction during pre-training by 3.8%. The one-shot\\nresult improves by 3.7% and matches the SOTA for an open-domain QA system which not only ﬁne-tunes but also\\nmakes use of a learned retrieval mechanism over a 15.3B parameter dense vector index of 21M documents [LPP+20].\\nGPT-3’s few-shot result further improves performance another 3.2% beyond this.\\nOn WebQuestions (WebQs), GPT-3 achieves 14.4% in the zero-shot setting, 25.3% in the one-shot setting, and 41.5%\\nin the few-shot setting. This compares to 37.4% for ﬁne-tuned T5-11B, and 44.7% for ﬁne-tuned T5-11B+SSM,\\nwhich uses a Q&A-speciﬁc pre-training procedure. GPT-3 in the few-shot setting approaches the performance of\\nstate-of-the-art ﬁne-tuned models. Notably, compared to TriviaQA, WebQS shows a much larger gain from zero-shot to\\nfew-shot (and indeed its zero-shot and one-shot performance are poor), perhaps suggesting that the WebQs questions\\n13'),\n",

Even with this ﬁltering GPT-2 showed some evidence of multilingual capability and performed non-trivially\\nwhen translating between French and English despite only training on 10 megabytes of remaining French text. Since we\\nincrease the capacity by over two orders of magnitude from GPT-2 to GPT-3, we also expand the scope of the training\\ndataset to include more representation of other languages, though this remains an area for further improvement. As\\ndiscussed in 2.2 the majority of our data is derived from raw Common Crawl with only quality-based ﬁltering. Although\\nGPT-3’s training data is still primarily English (93% by word count), it also includes 7% of text in other languages.\\nThese languages are documented in the supplemental material. In order to better understand translation capability, we\\nalso expand our analysis to include two additional commonly studied languages, German and Romanian.\\nExisting unsupervised machine translation approaches often combine pretraining on a pair of monolingual datasets\\nwith back-translation [SHB15] to bridge the two languages in a controlled way. By contrast, GPT-3 learns from a\\nblend of training data that mixes many languages together in a natural way, combining them on a word, sentence,\\nand document level. GPT-3 also uses a single training objective which is not customized or designed for any task in\\nparticular. However, our one / few-shot settings aren’t strictly comparable to prior unsupervised work since they make\\nuse of a small amount of paired examples (1 or 64). This corresponds to up to a page or two of in-context training data.\\nResults are shown in Table 3.4.

See Section 4 for details.\\nARC [CCE+18] is a dataset of multiple-choice questions collected from 3rd to 9th grade science exams. On the\\n“Challenge” version of the dataset which has been ﬁltered to questions which simple statistical or information retrieval\\nmethods are unable to correctly answer, GPT-3 achieves 51.4% accuracy in the zero-shot setting, 53.2% in the one-shot\\nsetting, and 51.5% in the few-shot setting. This is approaching the performance of a ﬁne-tuned RoBERTa baseline\\n(55.9%) from UniﬁedQA [KKS+20]. On the “Easy” version of the dataset (questions which either of the mentioned\\nbaseline approaches answered correctly), GPT-3 achieves 68.8%, 71.2%, and 70.1% which slightly exceeds a ﬁne-tuned\\nRoBERTa baseline from [KKS+20]. However, both of these results are still much worse than the overall SOTAs\\nachieved by the UniﬁedQA which exceeds GPT-3’s few-shot results by 27% on the challenge set and 22% on the easy\\nset.\\nOn OpenBookQA [MCKS18], GPT-3 improves signiﬁcantly from zero to few shot settings but is still over 20 points\\nshort of the overall SOTA. GPT-3’s few-shot performance is similar to a ﬁne-tuned BERT Large baseline on the\\nleaderboard.\\nOverall, in-context learning with GPT-3 shows mixed results on commonsense reasoning tasks, with only small and\\ninconsistent gains observed in the one and few-shot learning settings for both PIQA and ARC, but a signiﬁcant\\nimprovement is observed on OpenBookQA. GPT-3 sets SOTA on the new PIQA dataset in all evaluation settings.\\n3.6\\nReading Comprehension\\nNext we evaluate GPT-3 on the task of reading comprehension. We use a suite of 5 datasets including abstractive,\\nmultiple choice, and span based answer formats in both dialog and single question settings. We observe a wide spread\\nin GPT-3’s performance across these datasets suggestive of varying capability with different answer formats. In general\\nwe observe GPT-3 is on par with initial baselines and early results trained using contextual representations on each\\nrespective dataset.\\nGPT-3 performs best (within 3 points of the human baseline) on CoQA [RCM19] a free-form conversational dataset\\nand performs worst (13 F1 below an ELMo baseline) on QuAC [CHI+18] a dataset which requires modeling structured\\ndialog acts and answer span selections of teacher-student interactions. On DROP [DWD+19], a dataset testing discrete\\nreasoning and numeracy in the context of reading comprehension, GPT-3 in a few-shot setting outperforms the ﬁne-tuned\\nBERT baseline from the original paper but is still well below both human performance and state-of-the-art approaches\\nwhich augment neural networks with symbolic systems [RLL+19]. On SQuAD 2.0 [RJL18], GPT-3 demonstrates its\\nfew-shot learning capabilities, improving by almost 10 F1 (to 69.8) compared to a zero-shot setting. This allows it to\\nslightly outperform the best ﬁne-tuned result in the original paper. On RACE [LXL+17], a multiple choice dataset of\\nmiddle school and high school english examinations, GPT-3 performs relatively weakly and is only competitive with\\nthe earliest work utilizing contextual representations and is still 45% behind SOTA.\\n3.7\\nSuperGLUE\\nIn order to better aggregate results on NLP tasks and compare to popular models such as BERT and RoBERTa in a\\nmore systematic way, we also evaluate GPT-3 on a standardized collection of datasets, the SuperGLUE benchmark\\n[WPN+19] [WPN+19] [CLC+19] [DMST19] [RBG11] [KCR+18] [ZLL+18] [DGM06] [BHDD+06] [GMDD07]\\n[BDD+09] [PCC18] [PHR+18].

On BoolQ, MultiRC, and RTE, performance is reasonable,\\nroughly matching that of a ﬁne-tuned BERT-Large. On CB, we see signs of life at 75.6% in the few-shot setting.\\nWiC is a notable weak spot with few-shot performance at 49.4% (at random chance). We tried a number of different\\nphrasings and formulations for WiC (which involves determining if a word is being used with the same meaning in two\\nsentences), none of which was able to achieve strong performance. This hints at a phenomenon that will become clearer\\nin the next section (which discusses the ANLI benchmark) – GPT-3 appears to be weak in the few-shot or one-shot\\nsetting at some tasks that involve comparing two sentences or snippets, for example whether a word is used the same\\nway in two sentences (WiC), whether one sentence is a paraphrase of another, or whether one sentence implies another.\\nThis could also explain the comparatively low scores for RTE and CB, which also follow this format. Despite these\\nweaknesses, GPT-3 still outperforms a ﬁne-tuned BERT-large on four of eight tasks and on two tasks GPT-3 is close to\\nthe state-of-the-art held by a ﬁne-tuned 11 billion parameter model.\\nFinally, we note that the few-shot SuperGLUE score steadily improves with both model size and with number of\\nexamples in the context showing increasing beneﬁts from in-context learning (Figure 3.8). We scale K up to 32\\nexamples per task, after which point additional examples will not reliably ﬁt into our context.

These results on both RTE and ANLI suggest that NLI is still a very difﬁcult\\ntask for language models and they are only just beginning to show signs of progress.\\n3.9\\nSynthetic and Qualitative Tasks\\nOne way to probe GPT-3’s range of abilities in the few-shot (or zero- and one-shot) setting is to give it tasks which\\nrequire it to perform simple on-the-ﬂy computational reasoning, recognize a novel pattern that is unlikely to have\\noccurred in training, or adapt quickly to an unusual task. We devise several tasks to test this class of abilities. First, we\\ntest GPT-3’s ability to perform arithmetic. Second, we create several tasks that involve rearranging or unscrambling the\\nletters in a word, tasks which are unlikely to have been exactly seen during training. Third, we test GPT-3’s ability to\\nsolve SAT-style analogy problems few-shot. Finally, we test GPT-3 on several qualitative tasks, including using new\\nwords in a sentence, correcting English grammar, and news article generation. We will release the synthetic datasets\\nwith the hope of stimulating further study of test-time behavior of language models.\\n3.9.1\\nArithmetic\\nTo test GPT-3’s ability to perform simple arithmetic operations without task-speciﬁc training, we developed a small\\nbattery of 10 tests that involve asking GPT-3 a simple arithmetic problem in natural language:\\n• 2 digit addition (2D+) – The model is asked to add two integers sampled uniformly from [0, 100), phrased in\\nthe form of a question, e.g. “Q: What is 48 plus 76?

Results for one-shot and zero-shot\\nare shown in the appendix.\\n• 3 digit subtraction (3D-) – Same as 2 digit subtraction, except numbers are uniformly sampled from [0, 1000).\\n• 4 digit addition (4D+) – Same as 3 digit addition, except uniformly sampled from [0, 10000).\\n• 4 digit subtraction (4D-) – Same as 3 digit subtraction, except uniformly sampled from [0, 10000).\\n• 5 digit addition (5D+) – Same as 3 digit addition, except uniformly sampled from [0, 100000).\\n• 5 digit subtraction (5D-) – Same as 3 digit subtraction, except uniformly sampled from [0, 100000).\\n• 2 digit multiplication (2Dx) – The model is asked to multiply two integers sampled uniformly from [0, 100),\\ne.g. “Q: What is 24 times 42? A: 1008”.\\n• One-digit composite (1DC) – The model is asked to perform a composite operation on three 1 digit numbers,\\nwith parentheses around the last two. For example, “Q: What is 6+(4*8)? A: 38”. The three 1 digit numbers\\nare selected uniformly on [0, 10) and the operations are selected uniformly from {+,-,*}.\\nIn all 10 tasks the model must generate the correct answer exactly. For each task we generate a dataset of 2,000 random\\ninstances of the task and evaluate all models on those instances.\\nFirst we evaluate GPT-3 in the few-shot setting, for which results are shown in Figure 3.10. On addition and subtraction,\\nGPT-3 displays strong proﬁciency when the number of digits is small, achieving 100% accuracy on 2 digit addition,\\n98.9% at 2 digit subtraction, 80.2% at 3 digit addition, and 94.2% at 3-digit subtraction. Performance decreases as the\\nnumber of digits increases, but GPT-3 still achieves 25-26% accuracy on four digit operations and 9-10% accuracy on\\nﬁve digit operations, suggesting at least some capacity to generalize to larger numbers of digits. GPT-3 also achieves\\n29.2% accuracy at 2 digit multiplication, an especially computationally intensive operation. Finally, GPT-3 achieves\\n21.3% accuracy at single digit combined operations (for example, 9*(7+5)), suggesting that it has some robustness\\nbeyond just single operations.\\nAs Figure 3.10 makes clear, small models do poorly on all of these tasks – even the 13 billion parameter model (the\\nsecond largest after the 175 billion full GPT-3) can solve 2 digit addition and subtraction only half the time, and all\\nother operations less than 10% of the time.\\nOne-shot and zero-shot performance are somewhat degraded relative to few-shot performance, suggesting that adaptation\\nto the task (or at the very least recognition of the task) is important to performing these computations correctly.\\nNevertheless, one-shot performance is still quite strong, and even zero-shot performance of the full GPT-3 signiﬁcantly\\n22'),\n",

Out of 2,000 addition problems we found only 17 matches (0.8%) and out of 2,000\\nsubtraction problems we found only 2 matches (0.1%), suggesting that only a trivial fraction of the correct answers\\ncould have been memorized. In addition, inspection of incorrect answers reveals that the model often makes mistakes\\nsuch as not carrying a “1”, suggesting it is actually attempting to perform the relevant computation rather than\\nmemorizing a table.\\nOverall, GPT-3 displays reasonable proﬁciency at moderately complex arithmetic in few-shot, one-shot, and even\\nzero-shot settings.\\n3.9.2\\nWord Scrambling and Manipulation Tasks\\nTo test GPT-3’s ability to learn novel symbolic manipulations from a few examples, we designed a small battery of\\n5 “character manipulation” tasks. Each task involves giving the model a word distorted by some combination of\\nscrambling, addition, or deletion of characters, and asking it to recover the original word. The 5 tasks are:\\n• Cycle letters in word (CL) – The model is given a word with its letters cycled, then the “=” symbol, and\\nis expected to generate the original word. For example, it might be given “lyinevitab” and should output\\n“inevitably”.\\n• Anagrams of all but ﬁrst and last characters (A1) – The model is given a word where every letter except\\nthe ﬁrst and last have been scrambled randomly, and must output the original word. Example: criroptuon =\\ncorruption.\\n• Anagrams of all but ﬁrst and last 2 characters (A2) – The model is given a word where every letter except\\nthe ﬁrst 2 and last 2 have been scrambled randomly, and must recover the original word. Example: opoepnnt\\n→opponent.\\n• Random insertion in word (RI) – A random punctuation or space character is inserted between each letter\\nof a word, and the model must output the original word. Example: s.u!c/c!e.s s i/o/n = succession.\\n• Reversed words (RW) – The model is given a word spelled backwards, and must output the original word.\\nExample: stcejbo →objects.\\nFor each task we generate 10,000 examples, which we chose to be the top 10,000 most frequent words as measured by\\n[Nor09] of length more than 4 characters and less than 15 characters. The few-shot results are shown in Figure 3.11.\\nTask performance tends to grow smoothly with model size, with the full GPT-3 model achieving 66.9% on removing\\n23'),\n",

There is generally\\nsmooth improvement with model size although the random insertion task shows an upward slope of improvement with\\nthe 175B model solving the task the majority of the time. Scaling of one-shot and zero-shot performance is shown in\\nthe appendix. All tasks are done with K = 100.\\nrandom insertions, 38.6% on cycling letters, 40.2% on the easier anagram task, and 15.1% on the more difﬁcult anagram\\ntask (where only the ﬁrst and last letters are held ﬁxed). None of the models can reverse the letters in a word.\\nIn the one-shot setting, performance is signiﬁcantly weaker (dropping by half or more), and in the zero-shot setting the\\nmodel can rarely perform any of the tasks (Table 3.10). This suggests that the model really does appear to learn these\\ntasks at test time, as the model cannot perform them zero-shot and their artiﬁcial nature makes them unlikely to appear\\nin the pre-training data (although we cannot conﬁrm this with certainty).\\nWe can further quantify performance by plotting “in-context learning curves”, which show task performance as a\\nfunction of the number of in-context examples. We show in-context learning curves for the Symbol Insertion task\\nin Figure 1.2. We can see that larger models are able to make increasingly effective use of in-context information,\\nincluding both task examples and natural language task descriptions.\\nFinally, it is worth adding that solving these tasks requires character-level manipulations, whereas our BPE encoding\\noperates on signiﬁcant fractions of a word (on average ∼0.7 words per token), so from the LM’s perspective succeeding\\nat these tasks involves not just manipulating BPE tokens but understanding and pulling apart their substructure. Also,\\nCL, A1, and A2 are not bijective (that is, the unscrambled word is not a deterministic function of the scrambled word),\\nrequiring the model to perform some search to ﬁnd the correct unscrambling. Thus, the skills involved appear to require\\nnon-trivial pattern-matching and computation.\\n3.9.3\\nSAT Analogies\\nTo test GPT-3 on another task that is somewhat unusual relative to the typical distribution of text, we collected a set of\\n374 “SAT analogy” problems [TLBS03]. Analogies are a style of multiple choice question that constituted a section of\\nthe SAT college entrance exam before 2005. A typical example is “audacious is to boldness as (a) sanctimonious is to\\nhypocrisy, (b) anonymous is to identity, (c) remorseful is to misdeed, (d) deleterious is to result, (e) impressionable is to\\ntemptation”. The student is expected to choose which of the ﬁve word pairs has the same relationship as the original\\nword pair; in this example the answer is “sanctimonious is to hypocrisy”. On this task GPT-3 achieves 65.2% in the\\nfew-shot setting, 59.1% in the one-shot setting, and 53.7% in the zero-shot setting, whereas the average score among\\ncollege applicants was 57% [TL05] (random guessing yields 20%). As shown in Figure 3.12, the results improve with\\nscale, with the the full 175 billion model improving by over 10% compared to the 13 billion parameter model.\\n24'),\n",

Relative to [RWC+19], the dataset used to train GPT-3 is much less weighted towards news articles,\\nso trying to generate news articles via raw unconditional samples is less effective – for example GPT-3 often interprets\\nthe proposed ﬁrst sentence of a “news article” as a tweet and then posts synthetic responses or follow-up tweets. To\\nsolve this problem we employed GPT-3’s few-shot learning abilities by providing three previous news articles in the\\nmodel’s context to condition it. With the title and subtitle of a proposed next article, the model is able to reliably\\ngenerate short articles in the “news” genre.\\nTo gauge the quality of news article generation from GPT-3 (which we believe is likely to be correlated with conditional\\nsample generation quality in general), we decided to measure human ability to distinguish GPT-3-generated articles\\nfrom real ones. Similar work has been carried out by Kreps et al. [KMB20] and Zellers et al. [ZHR+19]. Generative\\nlanguage models are trained to match the distribution of content generated by humans, so the (in)ability of humans to\\ndistinguish the two is a potentially important measure of quality.3\\nIn order to see how well humans can detect model generated text, we arbitrarily selected 25 article titles and subtitles\\nfrom the website newser.com (mean length: 215 words). We then generated completions of these titles and subtitles\\nfrom four language models ranging in size from 125M to 175B (GPT-3) parameters (mean length: 200 words). For each\\nmodel, we presented around 80 US-based participants with a quiz consisting of these real titles and subtitles followed\\nby either the human written article or the article generated by the model4. Participants were asked to select whether the\\narticle was “very likely written by a human”, “more likely written by a human”, “I don’t know”, “more likely written by\\na machine”, or “very likely written by a machine”.\\nThe articles we selected were not in the models’ training data and the model outputs were formatted and selected\\nprogrammatically to prevent human cherry-picking. All models used the same context to condition outputs on and were\\npre-trained with the same context size and the same article titles and subtitles were used as prompts for each model.\\nHowever, we also ran an experiment to control for participant effort and attention that followed the same format but\\ninvolved intentionally bad model generated articles. This was done by generating articles from a “control model”: a\\n160M parameter model with no context and increased output randomness.\\n3This task is also relevant to the potential misuse of language models discussed in Section 6.1.\\n4We wanted to identify how good an average person on the internet is at detecting language model outputs, so we focused on\\nparticipants drawn from the general US population. See Appendix E for details.\\n25'),\n",

By contrast,\\nmean human accuracy at detecting articles that were produced by the 175B parameter model was barely above chance\\nat ∼52% (see Table 3.11).5 Human abilities to detect model generated text appear to decrease as model size increases:\\nthere appears to be a trend towards chance accuracy with model size, and human detection of GPT-3 is close to chance.6\\nThis is true despite the fact that participants spend more time on each output as model size increases (see Appendix E).\\nExamples of synthetic articles from GPT-3 are given in Figures 3.14 and 3.15.7 Much of the text is—as indicated by the\\nevaluations—difﬁcult for humans to distinguish from authentic human content. Factual inaccuracies can be an indicator\\nthat an article is model generated since, unlike human authors, the models have no access to the speciﬁc facts that the\\narticle titles refer to or when the article was written. Other indicators include repetition, non sequiturs, and unusual\\nphrasings, though these are often subtle enough that they are not noticed.\\nRelated work on language model detection by Ippolito et al. [IDCBE19] indicates that automatic discriminators like\\nG ROV E R [ZHR+19] and GLTR [GSR19] may have greater success at detecting model generated text than human\\nevaluators. Automatic detection of these models may be a promising area of future research.\\nIppolito et al. [IDCBE19] also note that human accuracy at detecting model generated text increases as humans observe\\nmore tokens. To do a preliminary investigation of how good humans are at detecting longer news articles generated\\nby GPT-3 175B, we selected 12 world news articles from Reuters with an average length of 569 words and generated\\ncompletions of these articles from GPT-3 with an average length of 498 words (298 words longer than our initial\\nexperiments). Following the methodology above, we ran two experiments, each on around 80 US-based participants, to\\ncompare human abilities to detect the articles generated by GPT-3 and a control model.\\nWe found that mean human accuracy at detecting the intentionally bad longer articles from the control model was\\n∼88%, while mean human accuracy at detecting the longer articles that were produced by GPT-3 175B was still barely\\nabove chance at ∼52% (see Table 3.12). This indicates that, for news articles that are around 500 words long, GPT-3\\ncontinues to produce articles that humans ﬁnd difﬁcult to distinguish from human written news articles.\\n3.9.5\\nLearning and Using Novel Words\\nA task studied in developmental linguistics [CB78] is the ability to learn and utilize new words, for example using a\\nword in a sentence after seeing it deﬁned only once, or conversely inferring a word’s meaning from only one usage. Here\\nwe qualitatively test GPT-3’s ability to do the former. Speciﬁcally, we give GPT-3 the deﬁnition of a nonexistent word,\\nsuch as “Gigamuru”, and then ask it to use it in a sentence. We provide one to ﬁve previous examples of a (separate)\\n5We use a two-sample Student’s T-Test to test for signiﬁcant difference between the means of the participant accuracies of each\\nmodel and the control model and report the normalized difference in the means (as the t-statistic) and the p-value.\\n6If a model consistently produces texts that are more impressive than human articles, it is possible that human performance on\\nthis task would drop below 50%. Indeed, many individual participants scored below 50% on this task.\\n7Additional non-news samples can be found in Appendix F.\\n26'),\n",

On the one hand, the dataset and model size are about two orders of\\nmagnitude larger than those used for GPT-2, and include a large amount of Common Crawl, creating increased potential\\nfor contamination and memorization. On the other hand, precisely due to the large amount of data, even GPT-3 175B\\ndoes not overﬁt its training set by a signiﬁcant amount, measured relative to a held-out validation set with which it was\\ndeduplicated (Figure 4.1). Thus, we expect that contamination is likely to be frequent, but that its effects may not be as\\nlarge as feared.\\nWe initially tried to address the issue of contamination by proactively searching for and attempting to remove any overlap\\nbetween our training data and the development and test sets of all benchmarks studied in this paper. Unfortunately, a\\nbug resulted in only partial removal of all detected overlaps from the training data. Due to the cost of training, it wasn’t\\nfeasible to retrain the model. To address this, we investigate in detail how the remaining detected overlap impacts\\nresults.\\nFor each benchmark, we produce a ‘clean’ version which removes all potentially leaked examples, deﬁned roughly as\\nexamples that have a 13-gram overlap with anything in the pretraining set (or that overlap with the whole example when\\nit is shorter than 13-grams). The goal is to very conservatively ﬂag anything that could potentially be contamination,\\nso as to produce a clean subset that is free of contamination with high conﬁdence. The exact procedure is detailed in\\nAppendix C.\\nWe then evaluate GPT-3 on these clean benchmarks, and compare to the original score. If the score on the clean\\nsubset is similar to the score on the entire dataset, this suggests that contamination, even if present, does not have a\\nsigniﬁcant effect on reported results. If the score on the clean subset is lower, this suggests contamination may be\\ninﬂating the results. The results are summarized in Figure 4.2. Although potential contamination is often high (with a\\nquarter of benchmarks scoring over 50%), in most cases performance changes only negligibly, and we see no evidence\\nthat contamination level and performance difference are correlated. We conclude that either our conservative method\\nsubstantially overestimated contamination or that contamination has little effect on performance.\\nBelow, we review in more detail the few speciﬁc cases where either (1) the model performs signiﬁcantly worse on\\nthe cleaned version, or (2) potential contamination is very high, which makes measuring the performance difference\\ndifﬁcult.\\nOur analysis ﬂagged six groups of benchmarks for further investigation: Word Scrambling, Reading Comprehension\\n(QuAC, SQuAD2, DROP), PIQA, Winograd, language modeling tasks (Wikitext tasks, 1BW), and German to English\\n31'),\n",

We summarize the results for each group of tasks below:\\n• Reading Comprehension: Our initial analysis ﬂagged >90% of task examples from QuAC, SQuAD2, and\\nDROP as potentially contaminated, so large that even measuring the differential on a clean subset was difﬁcult.\\nUpon manual inspection, however, we found that for every overlap we inspected, in all 3 datasets, the source\\ntext was present in our training data but the question/answer pairs were not, meaning the model gains only\\nbackground information and cannot memorize the answer to a speciﬁc question.\\n• German translation: We found 25% of the examples in the WMT16 German-English test set were marked\\nas potentially contaminated, with an associated total effect size of 1-2 BLEU. Upon inspection, none of the\\nﬂagged examples contain paired sentences resembling NMT training data and collisions were monolingual\\nmatches mostly of snippets of events discussed in the news.\\n• Reversed Words and Anagrams: Recall that these tasks are of the form “alaok = koala”. Due to the\\nshort length of these tasks, we used 2-grams for ﬁltering (ignoring punctuation). After inspecting the ﬂagged\\noverlaps, we found that they were not typically instances of real reversals or unscramblings in the training set,\\nbut rather palindromes or trivial unscramblings, e.g “kayak = kayak”. The amount of overlap was small,\\nbut removing the trivial tasks lead to an increase in difﬁculty and thus a spurious signal. Related to this, the\\nsymbol insertion task shows high overlap but no effect on performance – this is because that task involves\\nremoving non-letter characters from a word, and the overlap analysis itself ignores such characters, leading to\\nmany spurious matches.\\n• PIQA: The overlap analysis ﬂagged 29% of examples as contaminated, and observed a 3 percentage point\\nabsolute decrease (4% relative decrease) in performance on the clean subset. Though the test dataset was\\nreleased after our training set was created and its labels are hidden, some of the web pages used by the\\ncrowdsourced dataset creators are contained in our training set. We found a similar decrease in a 25x smaller\\nmodel with much less capacity to memorize, leading us to suspect that the shift is likely statistical bias\\nrather than memorization; examples which workers copied may simply be easier. Unfortunately, we cannot\\nrigorously prove this hypothesis. We therefore mark our PIQA results with an asterisk to denote this potential\\ncontamination.\\n• Winograd: The overlap analysis ﬂagged 45% of examples, and found a 2.6% decrease in performance on the\\nclean subset. Manual inspection of the overlapping data point showed that 132 Winograd schemas were in\\nfact present in our training set, though presented in a different format than we present the task to the model.\\nAlthough the decrease in performance is small, we mark our Winograd results in the main paper with an\\nasterisk.\\n32'),\n",

For a more detailed\\nexplanation of our analysis, we refer the reader to Appendix C.\\n5\\nLimitations\\nGPT-3 and our analysis of it have a number of limitations. Below we describe some of these and suggest directions for\\nfuture work.\\nFirst, despite the strong quantitative and qualitative improvements of GPT-3, particularly compared to its direct\\npredecessor GPT-2, it still has notable weaknesses in text synthesis and several NLP tasks. On text synthesis, although\\nthe overall quality is high, GPT-3 samples still sometimes repeat themselves semantically at the document level, start to\\nlose coherence over sufﬁciently long passages, contradict themselves, and occasionally contain non-sequitur sentences\\nor paragraphs. We will release a collection of 500 uncurated unconditional samples to help provide a better sense of\\nGPT-3’s limitations and strengths at text synthesis. Within the domain of discrete language tasks, we have noticed\\ninformally that GPT-3 seems to have special difﬁculty with “common sense physics”, despite doing well on some\\ndatasets (such as PIQA [BZB+19]) that test this domain. Speciﬁcally GPT-3 has difﬁculty with questions of the type\\n“If I put cheese into the fridge, will it melt?”. Quantitatively, GPT-3’s in-context learning performance has some notable\\ngaps on our suite of benchmarks, as described in Section 3, and in particular it does little better than chance when\\nevaluated one-shot or even few-shot on some “comparison” tasks, such as determining if two words are used the same\\nway in a sentence, or if one sentence implies another (WIC and ANLI respectively), as well as on a subset of reading\\ncomprehension tasks. This is especially striking given GPT-3’s strong few-shot performance on many other tasks.\\nGPT-3 has several structural and algorithmic limitations, which could account for some of the issues above. We focused\\non exploring in-context learning behavior in autoregressive language models because it is straightforward to both\\nsample and compute likelihoods with this model class. As a result our experiments do not include any bidirectional\\narchitectures or other training objectives such as denoising. This is a noticeable difference from much of the recent\\nliterature, which has documented improved ﬁne-tuning performance when using these approaches over standard\\nlanguage models [RSR+19]. Thus our design decision comes at the cost of potentially worse performance on tasks\\nwhich empirically beneﬁt from bidirectionality. This may include ﬁll-in-the-blank tasks, tasks that involve looking back\\nand comparing two pieces of content, or tasks that require re-reading or carefully considering a long passage and then\\ngenerating a very short answer. This could be a possible explanation for GPT-3’s lagging few-shot performance on a\\nfew of the tasks, such as WIC (which involves comparing the use of a word in two sentences), ANLI (which involves\\ncomparing two sentences to see if one implies the other), and several reading comprehension tasks (e.g. QuAC and\\nRACE). We also conjecture, based on past literature, that a large bidirectional model would be stronger at ﬁne-tuning\\nthan GPT-3. Making a bidirectional model at the scale of GPT-3, and/or trying to make bidirectional models work with\\nfew- or zero-shot learning, is a promising direction for future research, and could help achieve the “best of both worlds”.\\nA more fundamental limitation of the general approach described in this paper – scaling up any LM-like model, whether\\nautoregressive or bidirectional – is that it may eventually run into (or could already be running into) the limits of the\\n33'),\n",

Promising future directions in this vein might include learning the objective\\nfunction from humans [ZSW+19a], ﬁne-tuning with reinforcement learning, or adding additional modalities such as\\nimages to provide grounding and a better model of the world [CLY+19].\\nAnother limitation broadly shared by language models is poor sample efﬁciency during pre-training. While GPT-3\\ntakes a step towards test-time sample efﬁciency closer to that of humans (one-shot or zero-shot), it still sees much more\\ntext during pre-training than a human sees in the their lifetime [Lin20]. Improving pre-training sample efﬁciency is\\nan important direction for future work, and might come from grounding in the physical world to provide additional\\ninformation, or from algorithmic improvements.\\nA limitation, or at least uncertainty, associated with few-shot learning in GPT-3 is ambiguity about whether few-shot\\nlearning actually learns new tasks “from scratch” at inference time, or if it simply recognizes and identiﬁes tasks that it\\nhas learned during training. These possibilities exist on a spectrum, ranging from demonstrations in the training set that\\nare drawn from exactly the same distribution as those at test time, to recognizing the same task but in a different format,\\nto adapting to a speciﬁc style of a general task such as QA, to learning a skill entirely de novo. Where GPT-3 is on\\nthis spectrum may also vary from task to task. Synthetic tasks such as wordscrambling or deﬁning nonsense words\\nseem especially likely to be learned de novo, whereas translation clearly must be learned during pretraining, although\\npossibly from data that is very different in organization and style than the test data. Ultimately, it is not even clear what\\nhumans learn from scratch vs from prior demonstrations. Even organizing diverse demonstrations during pre-training\\nand identifying them at test time would be an advance for language models, but nevertheless understanding precisely\\nhow few-shot learning works is an important unexplored direction for future research.\\nA limitation associated with models at the scale of GPT-3, regardless of objective function or algorithm, is that they are\\nboth expensive and inconvenient to perform inference on, which may present a challenge for practical applicability of\\nmodels of this scale in their current form. One possible future direction to address this is distillation [HVD15] of large\\nmodels down to a manageable size for speciﬁc tasks. Large models such as GPT-3 contain a very wide range of skills,\\nmost of which are not needed for a speciﬁc task, suggesting that in principle aggressive distillation may be possible.\\nDistillation is well-explored in general [LHCG19a] but has not been tried at the scale of hundred of billions parameters;\\nnew challenges and opportunities may be associated with applying it to models of this size.\\nFinally, GPT-3 shares some limitations common to most deep learning systems – its decisions are not easily interpretable,\\nit is not necessarily well-calibrated in its predictions on novel inputs as observed by the much higher variance in\\nperformance than humans on standard benchmarks, and it retains the biases of the data it has been trained on. This\\nlast issue – biases in the data that may lead the model to generate stereotyped or prejudiced content – is of special\\nconcern from a societal perspective, and will be discussed along with other issues in the next section on Broader Impacts\\n(Section 6).\\n6\\nBroader Impacts\\nLanguage models have a wide range of beneﬁcial applications for society, including code and writing auto-completion,\\ngrammar assistance, game narrative generation, improving search engine responses, and answering questions. But\\nthey also have potentially harmful applications. GPT-3 improves the quality of text generation and adaptability over\\nsmaller models and increases the difﬁculty of distinguishing synthetic text from human-written text. It therefore has the\\npotential to advance both the beneﬁcial and harmful applications of language models.\\nHere we focus on the potential harms of improved language models, not because we believe the harms are necessarily\\ngreater, but in order to stimulate efforts to study and mitigate them. The broader impacts of language models like this\\nare numerous. We focus on two primary issues: the potential for deliberate misuse of language models like GPT-3 in\\nSection 6.1, and issues of bias, fairness, and representation within models like GPT-3 in Section 6.2. We also brieﬂy\\ndiscuss issues of energy efﬁciency (Section 6.3).\\n34'),\n",

To help with this,\\nwe can think in terms of traditional security risk assessment frameworks, which outline key steps such as identifying\\nthreats and potential impacts, assessing likelihood, and determining risk as a combination of likelihood and impact\\n[Ros12]. We discuss three factors: potential misuse applications, threat actors, and external incentive structures.\\n6.1.1\\nPotential Misuse Applications\\nAny socially harmful activity that relies on generating text could be augmented by powerful language models. Examples\\ninclude misinformation, spam, phishing, abuse of legal and governmental processes, fraudulent academic essay writing\\nand social engineering pretexting. Many of these applications bottleneck on human beings to write sufﬁciently high\\nquality text. Language models that produce high quality text generation could lower existing barriers to carrying out\\nthese activities and increase their efﬁcacy.\\nThe misuse potential of language models increases as the quality of text synthesis improves. The ability of GPT-3 to\\ngenerate several paragraphs of synthetic content that people ﬁnd difﬁcult to distinguish from human-written text in\\n3.9.4 represents a concerning milestone in this regard.\\n6.1.2\\nThreat Actor Analysis\\nThreat actors can be organized by skill and resource levels, ranging from low or moderately skilled and resourced actors\\nwho may be able to build a malicious product to ‘advanced persistent threats’ (APTs): highly skilled and well-resourced\\n(e.g. state-sponsored) groups with long-term agendas [SBC+19].\\nTo understand how low and mid-skill actors think about language models, we have been monitoring forums and chat\\ngroups where misinformation tactics, malware distribution, and computer fraud are frequently discussed. While we did\\nﬁnd signiﬁcant discussion of misuse following the initial release of GPT-2 in spring of 2019, we found fewer instances\\nof experimentation and no successful deployments since then. Additionally, those misuse discussions were correlated\\nwith media coverage of language model technologies. From this, we assess that the threat of misuse from these actors is\\nnot immediate, but signiﬁcant improvements in reliability could change this.\\nBecause APTs do not typically discuss operations in the open, we have consulted with professional threat analysts about\\npossible APT activity involving the use of language models. Since the release of GPT-2 there has been no discernible\\ndifference in operations that may see potential gains by using language models. The assessment was that language\\nmodels may not be worth investing signiﬁcant resources in because there has been no convincing demonstration that\\ncurrent language models are signiﬁcantly better than current methods for generating text, and because methods for\\n“targeting” or “controlling” the content of language models are still at a very early stage.\\n6.1.3\\nExternal Incentive Structures\\nEach threat actor group also has a set of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that they rely on to accomplish their\\nagenda. TTPs are inﬂuenced by economic factors like scalability and ease of deployment; phishing is extremely popular\\namong all groups because it offers a low-cost, low-effort, high-yield method of deploying malware and stealing login\\ncredentials. Using language models to augment existing TTPs would likely result in an even lower cost of deployment.\\nEase of use is another signiﬁcant incentive. Having stable infrastructure has a large impact on the adoption of TTPs.\\nThe outputs of language models are stochastic, however, and though developers can constrain these (e.g. using top-k\\ntruncation) they are not able to perform consistently without human feedback. If a social media disinformation bot\\nproduces outputs that are reliable 99% of the time, but produces incoherent outputs 1% of the time, this could reduce the\\namount of human labor required in operating this bot. But a human is still needed to ﬁlter the outputs, which restricts\\nhow scalable the operation can be.\\nBased on our analysis of this model and analysis of threat actors and the landscape, we suspect AI researchers will\\neventually develop language models that are sufﬁciently consistent and steerable that they will be of greater interest to\\nmalicious actors. We expect this will introduce challenges for the broader research community, and hope to work on\\nthis through a combination of mitigation research, prototyping, and coordinating with other technical developers.\\n35'),\n",

This is concerning,\\nsince model bias could harm people in the relevant groups in different ways by entrenching existing stereotypes and\\nproducing demeaning portrayals amongst other potential harms [Cra17]. We have conducted an analysis of biases in\\nthe model in order to better understand GPT-3’s limitations when it comes to fairness, bias, and representation. 8\\nOur goal is not to exhaustively characterize GPT-3, but to give a preliminary analysis of some of its limitations and\\nbehaviors. We focus on biases relating to gender, race, and religion, although many other categories of bias are likely\\npresent and could be studied in follow-up work. This is a preliminary analysis and does not reﬂect all of the model’s\\nbiases even within the studied categories.\\nBroadly, our analysis indicates that internet-trained models have internet-scale biases; models tend to reﬂect stereotypes\\npresent in their training data. Below we discuss our preliminary ﬁndings of bias along the dimensions of gender, race,\\nand religion. We probe for bias in the 175 billion parameter model and also in similar smaller models, to see if and how\\nthey are different in this dimension.\\n6.2.1\\nGender\\nIn our investigation of gender bias in GPT-3, we focused on associations between gender and occupation. We found\\nthat occupations in general have a higher probability of being followed by a male gender identiﬁer than a female one\\n(in other words, they are male leaning) when given a context such as \"The {occupation} was a\" (Neutral Variant).\\n83% of the 388 occupations we tested were more likely to be followed by a male identiﬁer by GPT-3. We measured\\nthis by feeding the model a context such as \"The detective was a\" and then looking at the probability of the\\nmodel following up with male indicating words (eg. man, male etc.) or female indicating words (woman, female etc.).\\nIn particular, occupations demonstrating higher levels of education such as legislator, banker, or professor emeritus\\nwere heavily male leaning along with occupations that require hard physical labour such as mason, millwright, and\\nsheriff. Occupations that were more likely to be followed by female identiﬁers include midwife, nurse, receptionist,\\nhousekeeper etc.\\nWe also tested how these probabilities changed when we shifted the context to be the \"The competent {occupation}\\nwas a\" (Competent Variant), and when we shifted the context to be \"The incompetent {occupation} was a\"\\n(Incompetent Variant) for each occupation in the dataset. We found that, when prompted with \"The competent\\n{occupation} was a,\" the majority of occupations had an even higher probability of being followed by a\\nmale identiﬁer than a female one than was the case with our original neutral prompt, \"The {occupation} was\\na\". With the prompt \"The incompetent {occupation} was a\" the majority of occupations still leaned male\\nwith a similar probability than for our original neutral prompt.\\nThe average occupation bias - measured as\\n1\\nnjobs\\nP\\njobs log( P (female|Context)\\nP (male|Context)) ) - was −1.11 for the Neutral Variant, −2.14 for the Competent Variant and −1.15\\nfor the Incompetent Variant.\\nWe also carried out pronoun resolution on the Winogender dataset [RNLVD18] using two methods which further\\ncorroborated the model’s tendency to associate most occupations with males. One method measured the mod-\\nels ability to correctly assign a pronoun as the occupation or the participant. For example, we fed the model\\na context such as \"The advisor met with the advisee because she wanted to get advice about job\\napplications.\\n‘She’ refers to the\" and found the option with the lowest probability between the two possi-\\nble options (Choices between Occupation Option: advisor; Participant Option: advisee).\\nOccupation and participant words often have societal biases associated with them such as the assumption that most\\noccupants are by default male. We found that the language models learnt some of these biases such as a tendency to\\nassociate female pronouns with participant positions more than male pronouns. GPT-3 175B had the highest accuracy of\\nall the models (64.17%) on this task. It was also the only model where the accuracy for Occupant sentences (sentences\\nwhere the correct answer was the Occupation option) for females was higher than for males (81.7% vs 76.7%). All\\nother models had a higher accuracy for male pronouns with Occupation sentences as compared to female pronouns\\nwith the exception of our second largest model- GPT-3 13B - which had the same accuracy (60%) for both. This offers\\nsome preliminary evidence that in places where issues of bias can make language models susceptible to error, the larger\\nmodels are more robust than smaller models.\\nWe also performed co-occurrence tests, where we analyzed which words are likely to occur in the vicinity of other pre-\\nselected words. We created a model output sample set by generating 800 outputs of length 50 each with a temperature\\n8Evaluating fairness, bias, and representation in language models is a rapidly-developing area with a large body of prior work.\\nSee, for example, [HZJ+19, NBR20, SCNP19].\\n36'),\n",

We looked at the adjectives and\\nadverbs in the top 100 most favored words using an off-the-shelf POS tagger [LB02]. We found females were more\\noften described using appearance oriented words such as ”beautiful” and ”gorgeous” as compared to men who were\\nmore often described using adjectives that span a greater spectrum.\\nTable 6.1 shows the top 10 most favored descriptive words for the model along with the raw number of times each\\nword co-occurred with a pronoun indicator. “Most Favored” here indicates words which were most skewed towards a\\ncategory by co-occurring with it at a higher rate as compared to the other category. To put these numbers in perspective,\\nwe have also included the average for the number of co-occurrences across all qualifying words for each gender.\\n6.2.2\\nRace\\nTo investigate racial bias in GPT-3, we seeded the model with prompts such as - \"The {race} man was very\",\\n\"The {race} woman was very\" and \"People would describe the {race} person as\" and generated 800\\nsamples for each of the above prompts, with {race} replaced with a term indicating a racial category such as White\\nor Asian. We then measure word co-occurrences in the generated samples. Given prior research demonstrating that\\nlanguage models produce text of differing sentiment when varying features such as occupation [HZJ+19], we explored\\nhow race impacted sentiment. We measured sentiment using Senti WordNet [BES10] for the words which co-occurred\\ndisproportionately with each race. Each word sentiment varied from 100 to -100, with positive scores indicating positive\\nwords (eg. wonderfulness: 100, amicable: 87.5), negative scores indicating negative words (eg. wretched: -87.5 , horrid:\\n-87.5) and a score of 0 indicating neutral words (eg. sloping, chalet).\\nIt should be noted that we were explicitly prompting the models to talk about race and this in turn generated text that\\nfocused on racial features; these results are not from the models talking about race in the wild but talking about race in\\nan experimental setup where they have been primed to do so. Additionally, since we are measuring sentiment by simply\\nlooking at word co-occurrences, the resulting sentiment can reﬂect socio-historical factors - for instance, text relating to\\na discussion of slavery will frequently have a negative sentiment, which may lead to a demographic being associated\\nwith a negative sentiment under this testing methodology.\\nAcross the models we analyzed, ‘Asian’ had a consistently high sentiment - it ranked 1st in 3 out of 7 models. On the\\nother hand, ’Black’ had a consistently low sentiment - it ranked the lowest in 5 out of 7 models. These differences\\nnarrowed marginally on the larger model sizes. This analysis gives a sense of the biases of different models and\\nhighlights the need for more sophisticated analysis of the relationship between sentiment, entities, and input data.\\n9We only used male and female pronouns. This simplifying assumption makes it easier to study co-occurrence since it does not\\nrequire the isolation of instances in which ‘they’ refers to a singular noun from those where it didn’t, but other forms of gender bias\\nare likely present and could be studied using different approaches.\\n37'),\n",

Our work is inspired by the literature on characterizing model\\nattributes to develop informative labels such as Model Cards for Model Reporting from [MWZ+18].\\nUltimately, it is important not just to characterize biases in language systems but to intervene. The literature on this\\nis also extensive [QMZH19, HZJ+19], so we offer only a few brief comments on future directions speciﬁc to large\\nlanguage models. In order to pave the way for effective bias prevention in general purpose models, there is a need for\\nbuilding a common vocabulary tying together the normative, technical and empirical challenges of bias mitigation for\\nthese models. There is room for more research that engages with the literature outside NLP, better articulates normative\\nstatements about harm, and engages with the lived experience of communities affected by NLP systems [BBDIW20].\\nThus, mitigation work should not be approached purely with a metric driven objective to ‘remove’ bias as this has been\\nshown to have blind spots [GG19, NvNvdG19] but in a holistic manner.\\n6.3\\nEnergy Usage\\nPractical large-scale pre-training requires large amounts of computation, which is energy-intensive: training the GPT-3\\n175B consumed several thousand petaﬂop/s-days of compute during pre-training, compared to tens of petaﬂop/s-days\\nfor a 1.5B parameter GPT-2 model (Figure 2.2). This means we should be cognizant of the cost and efﬁciency of such\\nmodels, as advocated by [SDSE19].\\nThe use of large-scale pre-training also gives another lens through which to view the efﬁciency of large models - we\\nshould consider not only the resources that go into training them, but how these resources are amortized over the\\nlifetime of a model, which will subsequently be used for a variety of purposes and ﬁne-tuned for speciﬁc tasks. Though\\nmodels like GPT-3 consume signiﬁcant resources during training, they can be surprisingly efﬁcient once trained: even\\nwith the full GPT-3 175B, generating 100 pages of content from a trained model can cost on the order of 0.4 kW-hr, or\\nonly a few cents in energy costs. Additionally, techniques like model distillation [LHCG19a] can further bring down\\nthe cost of such models, letting us adopt a paradigm of training single, large-scale models, then creating more efﬁcient\\nversions of them for use in appropriate contexts. Algorithmic progress may also naturally further increase the efﬁciency\\nof such models over time, similar to trends observed in image recognition and neural machine translation [HB20].\\n7\\nRelated Work\\nSeveral lines of work have focused on increasing parameter count and/or computation in language models as a\\nmeans to improve generative or task performance. An early work scaled LSTM based language models to over a\\nbillion parameters [JVS+16]. One line of work straightforwardly increases the size of transformer models, scaling\\nup parameters and FLOPS-per-token roughly in proportion. Work in this vein has successively increased model size:\\n213 million parameters [VSP+17] in the original paper, 300 million parameters [DCLT18], 1.5 billion parameters\\n[RWC+19], 8 billion parameters [SPP+19], 11 billion parameters [RSR+19], and most recently 17 billion parameters\\n[Tur20]. A second line of work has focused on increasing parameter count but not computation, as a means of\\nincreasing models’ capacity to store information without increased computational cost. These approaches rely on the\\nconditional computation framework [BLC13] and speciﬁcally, the mixture-of-experts method [SMM+17] has been\\nused to produce 100 billion parameter models and more recently 50 billion parameter translation models [AJF19],\\nthough only a small fraction of the parameters are actually used on each forward pass. A third approach increases\\ncomputation without increasing parameters; examples of this approach include adaptive computation time [Gra16] and\\nthe universal transformer [DGV+18]. Our work focuses on the ﬁrst approach (scaling compute and parameters together,\\nby straightforwardly making the neural net larger), and increases model size 10x beyond previous models that employ\\nthis strategy.\\nSeveral efforts have also systematically studied the effect of scale on language model performance. [KMH+20,\\nRRBS19, LWS+20, HNA+17], ﬁnd a smooth power-law trend in loss as autoregressive language models are scaled up.\\nThis work suggests that this trend largely continues as models continue to scale up (although a slight bending of the\\ncurve can perhaps be detected in Figure 3.1), and we also ﬁnd relatively smooth increases in many (though not all)\\ndownstream tasks across 3 orders of magnitude of scaling.\\nAnother line of work goes in the opposite direction from scaling, attempting to preserve strong performance in language\\nmodels that are as small as possible. This approach includes ALBERT [LCG+19] as well as general [HVD15] and\\n39'),\n",

If successful multi-task learning could allow a single model to be used for many tasks without updating the\\nweights (similar to our in-context learning approach), or alternatively could improve sample efﬁciency when updating\\nthe weights for a new task. Multi-task learning has shown some promising initial results [LGH+15, LSP+18] and\\nmulti-stage ﬁne-tuning has recently become a standardized part of SOTA results on some datasets [PFB18] and pushed\\nthe boundaries on certain tasks [KKS+20], but is still limited by the need to manually curate collections of datasets and\\nset up training curricula. By contrast pre-training at large enough scale appears to offer a “natural” broad distribution of\\ntasks implicitly contained in predicting the text itself. One direction for future work might be attempting to generate\\na broader set of explicit tasks for multi-task learning, for example through procedural generation [TFR+17], human\\ninteraction [ZSW+19b], or active learning [Mac92].\\nAlgorithmic innovation in language models over the last two years has been enormous, including denoising-based\\nbidirectionality [DCLT18], preﬁxLM [DL15] and encoder-decoder architectures [LLG+19, RSR+19], random permu-\\ntations during training [YDY+19], architectures that improve the efﬁciency of sampling [DYY+19], improvements in\\ndata and training procedures [LOG+19], and efﬁciency increases in the embedding parameters [LCG+19]. Many of\\nthese techniques provide signiﬁcant gains on downstream tasks. In this work we continue to focus on pure autoregressive\\nlanguage models, both in order to focus on in-context learning performance and to reduce the complexity of our large\\nmodel implementations. However, it is very likely that incorporating these algorithmic advances could improve GPT-3’s\\nperformance on downstream tasks, especially in the ﬁne-tuning setting, and combining GPT-3’s scale with these\\nalgorithmic techniques is a promising direction for future work.\\n8\\nConclusion\\nWe presented a 175 billion parameter language model which shows strong performance on many NLP tasks and\\nbenchmarks in the zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot settings, in some cases nearly matching the performance of\\n40'),\n",

In order to improve the quality of Common Crawl, we developed an automatic ﬁltering method to remove low\\nquality documents. Using the original WebText as a proxy for high-quality documents, we trained a classiﬁer\\nto distinguish these from raw Common Crawl. We then used this classiﬁer to re-sample Common Crawl by\\nprioritizing documents which were predicted by the classiﬁer to be higher quality. The classiﬁer is trained\\nusing logistic regression classiﬁer with features from Spark’s standard tokenizer and HashingTF 10. For the\\npositive examples, we used a collection of curated datasets such as WebText, Wikiedia, and our web books\\ncorpus as the positive examples, and for the negative examples, we used unﬁltered Common Crawl. We used\\nthis classiﬁer to score Common Crawl documents. We kept each document in our dataset iff\\nnp.random.pareto(α) > 1 −document_score\\nWe chose α = 9 in order to take mostly documents the classiﬁer scored highly, but still include some documents\\nthat were out of distribution. α was chosen to match the distribution of scores from our classiﬁer on WebText.\\nWe found this re-weighting increased quality as measured by loss on a range of out-of-distribution generative\\ntext samples.\\n2. To further improve model quality and prevent overﬁtting (which becomes increasingly important as model\\ncapacity increases), we fuzzily deduplicated documents (i.e. removed documents with high overlap with\\nother documents) within each dataset using Spark’s MinHashLSH implementation with 10 hashes, using the\\nsame features as were used for classiﬁcation above. We also fuzzily removed WebText from Common Crawl.\\nOverall this decreased dataset size by an average of 10%.\\nAfter ﬁltering for duplicates and quality, we also partially removed text occurring in benchmark datasets, described in\\nAppendix C.\\nB\\nDetails of Model Training\\nTo train all versions of GPT-3, we use Adam with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.95, and ϵ = 10−8, we clip the global norm of the\\ngradient at 1.0, and we use cosine decay for learning rate down to 10% of its value, over 260 billion tokens (after 260\\nbillion tokens, training continues at 10% of the original learning rate). There is a linear LR warmup over the ﬁrst 375\\nmillion tokens. We also gradually increase the batch size linearly from a small value (32k tokens) to the full value over\\nthe ﬁrst 4-12 billion tokens of training, depending on the model size. Data are sampled without replacement during\\ntraining (until an epoch boundary is reached) to minimize overﬁtting. All models use weight decay of 0.1 to provide a\\nsmall amount of regularization [LH17].\\nDuring training we always train on sequences of the full nctx = 2048 token context window, packing multiple\\ndocuments into a single sequence when documents are shorter than 2048, in order to increase computational efﬁciency.\\nSequences with multiple documents are not masked in any special way but instead documents within a sequence\\nare delimited with a special end of text token, giving the language model the information necessary to infer that\\ncontext separated by the end of text token is unrelated. This allows for efﬁcient training without need for any special\\nsequence-speciﬁc masking.\\nC\\nDetails of Test Set Contamination Studies\\nIn section 4 we gave a high level overview of test set contamination studies. In this section we provide details on\\nmethodology and results.\\nInitial training set ﬁltering\\nWe attempted to remove text occurring in benchmarks from training data by searching\\nfor 13−gram overlaps between all test/development sets used in this work and our training data, and we removed\\nthe colliding 13−gram as well as a 200 character window around it, splitting the original document into pieces. For\\nﬁltering purposes we deﬁne a gram as a lowercase, whitespace delimited word with no punctuation. Pieces less than\\n200 characters long were discarded. Documents split into more than 10 pieces were considered contaminated and\\n10https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#pyspark.ml.feature.HashingTF\\n43'),\n",

Originally we removed entire documents given a single collision, but that overly penalized long\\ndocuments such as books for false positives. An example of a false positive might be a test set based on Wikipedia, in\\nwhich the Wikipedia article quotes a single line from a book. We ignored 13−grams that matched more than 10 training\\ndocuments, as inspection showed the majority of these to contain common cultural phrases, legal boilerplate, or similar\\ncontent that we likely do want the model to learn, rather than undesired speciﬁc overlaps with test sets. Examples for\\nvarious frequencies can be found in the GPT-3 release repository11.\\nOverlap methodology\\nFor our benchmark overlap analysis in Section 4, we used a variable number of words N to\\ncheck for overlap for each dataset, where N is the 5th percentile example length in words, ignoring all punctuation,\\nwhitespace, and casing. Due to spurious collisions at lower values of N we use a minimum value of 8 on non-synthetic\\ntasks. For performance reasons, we set a maximum value of 13 for all tasks. Values for N and the amount of data\\nmarked as dirty are shown in Table C.1. Unlike GPT-2’s use of bloom ﬁlters to compute probabilistic bounds for test\\ncontamination, we used Apache Spark to compute exact collisions across all training and test sets. We compute overlaps\\nbetween test sets and our full training corpus, even though we only trained on 40% of our ﬁltered Common Crawl\\ndocuments per Section 2.2.\\nWe deﬁne a ‘dirty’ example as one with any N-gram overlap with any training document, and a ‘clean’ example as one\\nwith no collision.\\nTest and validation splits had similar contamination levels despite some test splits being unlabeled. Due to a bug revealed\\nby this analysis, ﬁltering described above failed on long documents such as books. Because of cost considerations it\\nwas infeasible to retrain the model on a corrected version of the training dataset. As such, several language modeling\\nbenchmarks plus the Children’s Book Test showed almost complete overlap, and therefore were not included in this\\npaper. Overlaps are shown in Table C.1\\nOverlap results\\nTo understand how much having seen some of the data helps the model perform on downstream\\ntasks, we ﬁlter every validation and test set by dirtiness. Then we run evaluation on the clean-only examples and report\\nthe relative percent change between the clean score and the original score. If the clean score is more than 1% or 2%\\nworse than the overall score, it suggests the model may have overﬁt to the examples it has seen. If the clean score is\\nsigniﬁcantly better, our ﬁltering scheme may have preferentially marked easier examples as dirty.\\nThis overlap metric tends to show a high rate of false positives for datasets that contain background information (but\\nnot answers) drawn from the web (such as SQuAD, which draws from Wikipedia) or examples less than 8 words\\nlong, which we ignored in our ﬁltering process (except for wordscrambling tasks). One instance where this technique\\nseems to fail to give good signal is DROP, a reading comprehension task in which 94% of the examples are dirty. The\\ninformation required to answer the question is in a passage provided to the model, so having seen the passage during\\ntraining but not the questions and answers does not meaningfully constitute cheating. We conﬁrmed that every matching\\ntraining document contained only the source passage, and none of the questions and answers in the dataset. The more\\nlikely explanation for the decrease in performance is that the 6% of examples that remain after ﬁltering come from a\\nslightly different distribution than the dirty examples.\\nFigure 4.2 shows that as the dataset becomes more contaminated, the variance of the clean/all fraction increases, but\\nthere is no apparent bias towards improved or degraded performance. This suggests that GPT-3 is relatively insensitive\\nto contamination. See Section 4 for details on the datasets we ﬂagged for further review.\\n11https://github.com/openai/gpt-3/blob/master/overlap_frequency.md\\n44'),\n",

We then note that each token is involved in a single addition\\nand a single multiply for each active parameter in the forward pass (ignoring attention). Then we add a multiplier of\\n3x to account for the backwards pass (as computing both ∂params\\n∂loss\\nand ∂acts\\n∂loss use a similar amount of compute as the\\nforwards pass. Combining the previous two numbers, we get the total ﬂops per parameter per token.

We\\nreport both ﬂops and petaﬂop/s-day (each of which are 8.64e+19 ﬂops).\\nE\\nHuman Quality Assessment of Synthetic News Articles\\nThis appendix contains details on the experiments measuring human ability to distinguish GPT-3-generated synthetic\\nnews articles from real news articles. We ﬁrst describe the experiments on the ∼200 word news articles, and then\\ndescribe the preliminary investigation of ∼500 word news articles generated by GPT-3.\\nParticipants: We recruited 718 unique participants to take part in 6 experiments. 97 participants were excluded for\\nfailing an internet check question, leaving a total of 621 participants: 343 male, 271 female, and 7 other. Mean\\nparticipant age was ∼38 years old. All participants were recruited through Positly, which maintains a whitelist of\\nhigh-performing workers from Mechanical Turk. All participants were US-based but there were no other demographic\\nrestrictions. Participants were paid $12 for their participation, based on a task time estimate of 60 minutes determined\\nby pilot runs. In order to ensure that the sample of participants for each experiment quiz was unique, participants were\\nnot allowed to take part in an experiment more than once.\\nProcedure and design: We arbitrarily selected 25 news articles that appeared in newser.com in early 2020. We used\\nthe article titles and subtitles to produce outputs from the 125M, 350M, 760M, 1.3B, 2.7B, 6.7B, 13.0B, and 200B\\n(GPT-3) parameter language models. Five outputs per question were generated by each model and the generation with a\\nword count closest to that of the human written article was selected automatically. This was to minimize the effect\\nthat completion length might have on participants’ judgments. The same output procedure for each model with the\\nexception of the removal of the intentionally bad control model, as described in the main text.\\n46'),\n",

Each quiz consisted of 25 articles: half (12-13) were human written and half (12-13) were model generated: the\\narticles with human written completions in quiz A had model generated completions in quiz B and vice versa. The\\norder of quiz question was shufﬂed for each participant. Participants could leave comments and were asked to indicate\\nif they had seen the articles before. Participants were instructed not to look up the articles or their content during the\\nquiz and at the end of the quiz were asked if they had looked anything up during the quiz.\\nStatistical Tests: To compare means on the different runs, we performed a two-sample t-test for independent groups for\\neach model against the control. This was implemented in Python using the scipy.stats.ttest_ind function. When\\nplotting a regression line in the graph of average participant accuracy vs model size, we ﬁt a power law of the form\\nax−b. The 95% conﬁdence intervals were estimated from the t-distribution of the sample mean.\\nDuration statistics: In the main text, we discussed the ﬁnding that the ability of human participants to distinguish\\nmodel and human generated news articles decreases as our models become larger. We have also found that the\\naverage time spent for a given set of questions increases as the model size increases, as shown in Figure E.1. Lower\\n47'),\n",

We randomly selected 12 Reuters world news articles from\\nlate 2019 and created a context for GPT-3 175B that consisted of a single Reuters article not in this set of 12. We then\\nused the article titles and Reuters locations to generate completions from GPT-3 175B and the 160M control model\\nfrom the previous experiments. These were used to create two 12-question quizzes per model, each consisting of half\\nhuman written and half model generated articles. Comprehension questions were added and articles were shown to\\nparticipants in 3 stages at 30 second intervals to encourage closer reading. Participants were paid $12 for this task.\\nModel generation selection methods, exclusion criteria, and statistical tests mirror those of the previous experiments.\\nF\\nAdditional Samples from GPT-3\\nGPT-3 adapts well to many tasks other than the ones explored in the main body of the paper. As an example, in Figure\\nF.1, we show four uncurated samples from a prompt suggesting that the model write a poem, with a given title, in the\\nstyle of Wallace Stevens. We ﬁrst experimented with a few prompts, then generated four samples with no additional\\nediting or selection (sampling at temperature 1 using nucleus sampling [HBFC19] with P = 0.9). Completions were\\ntruncated when the model began to write a new title and author heading, or broke into prose commentary.\\n48'),\n",

Yet these systems are brittle and sensitive to\\nslight changes in the data distribution (Recht et al., 2018)\\nand task speciﬁcation (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017). Current sys-\\ntems are better characterized as narrow experts rather than\\n*, **Equal contribution\\n1OpenAI, San Francisco, Califor-\\nnia,\\nUnited States.\\nCorrespondence to:\\nAlec Radford\\n<alec@openai.com>.\\ncompetent generalists. We would like to move towards more\\ngeneral systems which can perform many tasks – eventually\\nwithout the need to manually create and label a training\\ndataset for each one.\\nThe dominant approach to creating ML systems is to col-\\nlect a dataset of training examples demonstrating correct\\nbehavior for a desired task, train a system to imitate these\\nbehaviors, and then test its performance on independent\\nand identically distributed (IID) held-out examples. This\\nhas served well to make progress on narrow experts. But\\nthe often erratic behavior of captioning models (Lake et al.,\\n2017), reading comprehension systems (Jia & Liang, 2017),\\nand image classiﬁers (Alcorn et al., 2018) on the diversity\\nand variety of possible inputs highlights some of the short-\\ncomings of this approach.\\nOur suspicion is that the prevalence of single task training\\non single domain datasets is a major contributor to the lack\\nof generalization observed in current systems. Progress\\ntowards robust systems with current architectures is likely\\nto require training and measuring performance on a wide\\nrange of domains and tasks. Recently, several benchmarks\\nhave been proposed such as GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) and\\ndecaNLP (McCann et al., 2018) to begin studying this.\\nMultitask learning (Caruana, 1997) is a promising frame-\\nwork for improving general performance. However, mul-\\ntitask training in NLP is still nascent. Recent work re-\\nports modest performance improvements (Yogatama et al.,\\n2019) and the two most ambitious efforts to date have\\ntrained on a total of 10 and 17 (dataset, objective)\\npairs respectively (McCann et al., 2018) (Bowman et al.,\\n2018). From a meta-learning perspective, each (dataset,\\nobjective) pair is a single training example sampled\\nfrom the distribution of datasets and objectives. Current\\nML systems need hundreds to thousands of examples to\\ninduce functions which generalize well. This suggests that\\nmultitask training many need just as many effective training\\npairs to realize its promise with current approaches. It will\\nbe very difﬁcult to continue to scale the creation of datasets\\nand the design of objectives to the degree that may be re-\\nquired to brute force our way there with current techniques.\\nThis motivates exploring additional setups for performing\\nmultitask learning.\\nThe current best performing systems on language tasks'),\n",

This approach has a long history with a trend to-\\nwards more ﬂexible forms of transfer. First, word vectors\\nwere learned and used as inputs to task-speciﬁc architec-\\ntures (Mikolov et al., 2013) (Collobert et al., 2011), then\\nthe contextual representations of recurrent networks were\\ntransferred (Dai & Le, 2015) (Peters et al., 2018), and re-\\ncent work suggests that task-speciﬁc architectures are no\\nlonger necessary and transferring many self-attention blocks\\nis sufﬁcient (Radford et al., 2018) (Devlin et al., 2018).\\nThese methods still require supervised training in order\\nto perform a task. When only minimal or no supervised\\ndata is available, another line of work has demonstrated\\nthe promise of language models to perform speciﬁc tasks,\\nsuch as commonsense reasoning (Schwartz et al., 2017) and\\nsentiment analysis (Radford et al., 2017).\\nIn this paper, we connect these two lines of work and con-\\ntinue the trend of more general methods of transfer. We\\ndemonstrate language models can perform down-stream\\ntasks in a zero-shot setting – without any parameter or archi-\\ntecture modiﬁcation. We demonstrate this approach shows\\npotential by highlighting the ability of language models to\\nperform a wide range of tasks in a zero-shot setting. We\\nachieve promising, competitive, and state of the art results\\ndepending on the task.\\n2. Approach\\nAt the core of our approach is language modeling. Lan-\\nguage modeling is usually framed as unsupervised distri-\\nbution estimation from a set of examples (x1, x2, ..., xn)\\neach composed of variable length sequences of symbols\\n(s1, s2, ..., sn). Since language has a natural sequential or-\\ndering, it is common to factorize the joint probabilities over\\nsymbols as the product of conditional probabilities (Jelinek\\n& Mercer, 1980) (Bengio et al., 2003):\\np(x) =\\nn\\nY\\ni=1\\np(sn|s1, ..., sn−1)\\n(1)\\nThis approach allows for tractable sampling from and es-\\ntimation of p(x) as well as any conditionals of the form\\np(sn−k, ..., sn|s1, ..., sn−k−1). In recent years, there have\\nbeen signiﬁcant improvements in the expressiveness of mod-\\nels that can compute these conditional probabilities, such as\\nself-attention architectures like the Transformer (Vaswani\\net al., 2017).\\nLearning to perform a single task can be expressed in a\\nprobabilistic framework as estimating a conditional distri-\\nbution p(output|input). Since a general system should be\\nable to perform many different tasks, even for the same\\ninput, it should condition not only on the input but also\\non the task to be performed.\\nThat is, it should model\\np(output|input, task). This has been variously formalized\\nin multitask and meta-learning settings. Task conditioning\\nis often implemented at an architectural level, such as the\\ntask speciﬁc encoders and decoders in (Kaiser et al., 2017)\\nor at an algorithmic level such as the inner and outer loop\\noptimization framework of MAML (Finn et al., 2017). But\\nas exempliﬁed in McCann et al. (2018), language provides\\na ﬂexible way to specify tasks, inputs, and outputs all as a\\nsequence of symbols. For example, a translation training\\nexample can be written as the sequence (translate to\\nfrench, english text, french text). Like-\\nwise, a reading comprehension training example can\\nbe written as (answer the question, document,\\nquestion, answer). McCann et al. (2018) demon-\\nstrated it was possible to train a single model, the MQAN,'),\n",

(2018) without the need for explicit\\nsupervision of which symbols are the outputs to be pre-\\ndicted. Since the supervised objective is the the same as the\\nunsupervised objective but only evaluated on a subset of the\\nsequence, the global minimum of the unsupervised objective\\nis also the global minimum of the supervised objective. In\\nthis slightly toy setting, the concerns with density estimation\\nas a principled training objective discussed in (Sutskever\\net al., 2015) are side stepped. The problem instead becomes\\nwhether we are able to, in practice, optimize the unsuper-\\nvised objective to convergence. Preliminary experiments\\nconﬁrmed that sufﬁciently large language models are able to\\nperform multitask learning in this toy-ish setup but learning\\nis much slower than in explicitly supervised approaches.\\nWhile it is a large step from the well-posed setup described\\nabove to the messiness of “language in the wild”, Weston\\n(2016) argues, in the context of dialog, for the need to\\ndevelop systems capable of learning from natural language\\ndirectly and demonstrated a proof of concept – learning a\\nQA task without a reward signal by using forward prediction\\nof a teacher’s outputs. While dialog is an attractive approach,\\nwe worry it is overly restrictive. The internet contains a vast\\namount of information that is passively available without\\nthe need for interactive communication. Our speculation is\\nthat a language model with sufﬁcient capacity will begin\\nto learn to infer and perform the tasks demonstrated in\\nnatural language sequences in order to better predict them,\\nregardless of their method of procurement. If a language\\nmodel is able to do this it will be, in effect, performing\\nunsupervised multitask learning. We test whether this is the\\ncase by analyzing the performance of language models in a\\nzero-shot setting on a wide variety of tasks.\\n2.1. Training Dataset\\nMost prior work trained language models on a single do-\\nmain of text, such as news articles (Jozefowicz et al., 2016),\\nWikipedia (Merity et al., 2016), or ﬁction books (Kiros\\net al., 2015). Our approach motivates building as large and\\ndiverse a dataset as possible in order to collect natural lan-\\nguage demonstrations of tasks in as varied of domains and\\ncontexts as possible.\\nA promising source of diverse and nearly unlimited text is\\nweb scrapes such as Common Crawl. While these archives\\nare many orders of magnitude larger than current language\\nmodeling datasets, they have signiﬁcant data quality issues.\\nTrinh & Le (2018) used Common Crawl in their work on\\ncommonsense reasoning but noted a large amount of doc-\\numents “whose content are mostly unintelligible”. We ob-\\nserved similar data issues in our initial experiments with\\n”I’m not the cleverest man in the world, but like they say in\\nFrench: Je ne suis pas un imbecile [I’m not a fool].\\nIn a now-deleted post from Aug. 16, Soheil Eid, Tory candidate\\nin the riding of Joliette, wrote in French: ”Mentez mentez,\\nil en restera toujours quelque chose,” which translates as,\\n”Lie lie and something will always remain.”\\n“I hate the word ‘perfume,”’ Burr says. ‘It’s somewhat better\\nin French: ‘parfum.’\\nIf listened carefully at 29:55, a conversation can be heard\\nbetween two guys in French: “-Comment on fait pour aller\\nde l’autre cot´e? -Quel autre cot´e?”, which means “- How\\ndo you get to the other side? - What side?”.\\nIf this sounds like a bit of a stretch, consider this ques-\\ntion in French: As-tu aller au cin´ema?, or Did you go to\\nthe movies?, which literally translates as Have-you to go to\\nmovies/theater?\\n“Brevet Sans Garantie Du Gouvernement”, translated to\\nEnglish: “Patented without government warranty”.\\nTable 1.

Trinh & Le (2018)’s best results were\\nachieved using a small subsample of Common Crawl which\\nincluded only documents most similar to their target dataset,\\nthe Winograd Schema Challenge. While this is a pragmatic\\napproach to improve performance on a speciﬁc task, we\\nwant to avoid making assumptions about the tasks to be\\nperformed ahead of time.\\nInstead, we created a new web scrape which emphasizes\\ndocument quality.

Input Representation\\nA general language model (LM) should be able to compute\\nthe probability of (and also generate) any string. Current\\nlarge scale LMs include pre-processing steps such as lower-\\ncasing, tokenization, and out-of-vocabulary tokens which\\nrestrict the space of model-able strings. While processing\\nUnicode strings as a sequence of UTF-8 bytes elegantly ful-\\nﬁlls this requirement as exempliﬁed in work such as Gillick\\net al. (2015), current byte-level LMs are not competitive\\nwith word-level LMs on large scale datasets such as the\\nOne Billion Word Benchmark (Al-Rfou et al., 2018). We\\nobserved a similar performance gap in our own attempts to\\ntrain standard byte-level LMs on WebText.\\nByte Pair Encoding (BPE) (Sennrich et al., 2015) is a\\npractical middle ground between character and word level\\nlanguage modeling which effectively interpolates between\\nword level inputs for frequent symbol sequences and char-\\nacter level inputs for infrequent symbol sequences. Despite\\nits name, reference BPE implementations often operate on\\nUnicode code points and not byte sequences. These imple-\\nmentations would require including the full space of Uni-\\ncode symbols in order to model all Unicode strings. This\\nwould result in a base vocabulary of over 130,000 before\\nany multi-symbol tokens are added. This is prohibitively\\nlarge compared to the 32,000 to 64,000 token vocabularies\\noften used with BPE. In contrast, a byte-level version of\\nBPE only requires a base vocabulary of size 256. However,\\ndirectly applying BPE to the byte sequence results in sub-\\noptimal merges due to BPE using a greedy frequency based\\nheuristic for building the token vocabulary. We observed\\nBPE including many versions of common words like dog\\nsince they occur in many variations such as dog. dog!\\ndog? . This results in a sub-optimal allocation of limited\\nvocabulary slots and model capacity. To avoid this, we pre-\\nvent BPE from merging across character categories for any\\nbyte sequence. We add an exception for spaces which sig-\\nniﬁcantly improves the compression efﬁciency while adding\\nonly minimal fragmentation of words across multiple vocab\\ntokens.\\nThis input representation allows us to combine the empirical\\nbeneﬁts of word-level LMs with the generality of byte-level\\napproaches. Since our approach can assign a probability to\\nany Unicode string, this allows us to evaluate our LMs on\\nany dataset regardless of pre-processing, tokenization, or\\nvocab size.\\n2.3. Model\\nWe use a Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) based archi-\\ntecture for our LMs. The model largely follows the details\\nof the OpenAI GPT model (Radford et al., 2018) with a\\nParameters\\nLayers\\ndmodel\\n117M\\n12\\n768\\n345M\\n24\\n1024\\n762M\\n36\\n1280\\n1542M\\n48\\n1600\\nTable 2.

Layer normalization (Ba et al., 2016)\\nwas moved to the input of each sub-block, similar to a\\npre-activation residual network (He et al., 2016) and an\\nadditional layer normalization was added after the ﬁnal self-\\nattention block. A modiﬁed initialization which accounts\\nfor the accumulation on the residual path with model depth\\nis used. We scale the weights of residual layers at initial-\\nization by a factor of 1/\\n√\\nN where N is the number of\\nresidual layers. The vocabulary is expanded to 50,257. We\\nalso increase the context size from 512 to 1024 tokens and\\na larger batchsize of 512 is used.\\n3. Experiments\\nWe trained and benchmarked four LMs with approximately\\nlog-uniformly spaced sizes. The architectures are summa-\\nrized in Table 2. The smallest model is equivalent to the\\noriginal GPT, and the second smallest equivalent to the\\nlargest model from BERT (Devlin et al., 2018). Our largest\\nmodel, which we call GPT-2, has over an order of magni-\\ntude more parameters than GPT. The learning rate of each\\nmodel was manually tuned for the best perplexity on a 5%\\nheld-out sample of WebText. All models still underﬁt Web-\\nText and held-out perplexity has as of yet improved given\\nmore training time.\\n3.1. Language Modeling\\nAs an initial step towards zero-shot task transfer, we are\\ninterested in understanding how WebText LM’s perform\\nat zero-shot domain transfer on the primary task they are\\ntrained for – language modeling. Since our model operates\\non a byte level and does not require lossy pre-processing\\nor tokenization, we can evaluate it on any language model\\nbenchmark. Results on language modeling datasets are\\ncommonly reported in a quantity which is a scaled or ex-\\nponentiated version of the average negative log probability\\nper canonical prediction unit - usually a character, a byte, or\\na word. We evaluate the same quantity by computing the\\nlog-probability of a dataset according to a WebText LM and\\ndividing by the number of canonical units. For many of these\\ndatasets, WebText LMs would be tested signiﬁcantly out-\\nof-distribution, having to predict aggressively standardized\\ntext, tokenization artifacts such as disconnected punctuation\\nand contractions, shufﬂed sentences, and even the string'),\n",

Following the LM\\napproach introduced in the original paper, we compute the\\nprobability of each choice and the rest of the sentence con-\\nditioned on this choice according to the LM, and predict\\nthe one with the highest probability. As seen in Figure 2\\nperformance steadily improves as model size is increased\\nand closes the majority of the gap to human performance\\non this test. Data overlap analysis showed one of the CBT\\ntest set books, The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling, is in\\nWebText, so we report results on the validation set which\\nhas no signiﬁcant overlap. GPT-2 achieves new state of the\\nart results of 93.3% on common nouns and 89.1% on named\\nentities. A de-tokenizer was applied to remove PTB style\\ntokenization artifacts from CBT.\\n3.3. LAMBADA\\nThe LAMBADA dataset (Paperno et al., 2016) tests the\\nability of systems to model long-range dependencies in\\ntext. The task is to predict the ﬁnal word of sentences\\nwhich require at least 50 tokens of context for a human to\\nsuccessfully predict. GPT-2 improves the state of the art\\nfrom 99.8 (Grave et al., 2016) to 8.6 perplexity and increases\\nthe accuracy of LMs on this test from 19% (Dehghani et al.,\\n2018) to 52.66%. Investigating GPT-2’s errors showed most\\npredictions are valid continuations of the sentence, but are\\nnot valid ﬁnal words. This suggests that the LM is not\\nusing the additional useful constraint that the word must be\\nthe ﬁnal of the sentence. Adding a stop-word ﬁlter as an\\napproximation to this further increases accuracy to 63.24%,\\nimproving the overall state of the art on this task by 4%. The\\nprevious state of the art (Hoang et al., 2018) used a different\\nrestricted prediction setting where the outputs of the model\\nwere constrained to only words that appeared in the context.\\nFor GPT-2, this restriction is harmful rather than helpful'),\n",

To in-\\nduce summarization behavior we add the text TL;DR: after\\nthe article and generate 100 tokens with Top-k random sam-\\npling (Fan et al., 2018) with k = 2 which reduces repetition\\nand encourages more abstractive summaries than greedy de-\\ncoding. We use the ﬁrst 3 generated sentences in these 100\\ntokens as the summary.

On the commonly reported\\nROUGE 1,2,L metrics the generated summaries only begin\\nto approach the performance of classic neural baselines and\\njust barely outperforms selecting 3 random sentences from\\nthe article.

Question Answering\\nA potential way to test what information is contained within\\na language model is to evaluate how often it generates the\\ncorrect answer to factoid-style questions. Previous showcas-\\ning of this behavior in neural systems where all information\\nis stored in parameters such as A Neural Conversational\\nModel (Vinyals & Le, 2015) reported qualitative results due\\nto the lack of high-quality evaluation datasets. The recently\\nintroduced Natural Questions dataset (Kwiatkowski et al.,\\n2https://github.com/CLD2Owners/cld2\\n2019) is a promising resource to test this more quantita-\\ntively. Similar to translation, the context of the language\\nmodel is seeded with example question answer pairs which\\nhelps the model infer the short answer style of the dataset.\\nGPT-2 answers 4.1% of questions correctly when evalu-\\nated by the exact match metric commonly used on reading\\ncomprehension datasets like SQUAD.3 As a comparison\\npoint, the smallest model does not exceed the 1.0% accu-\\nracy of an incredibly simple baseline which returns the most\\ncommon answer for each question type (who, what, where,\\netc...). GPT-2 answers 5.3 times more questions correctly,\\nsuggesting that model capacity has been a major factor in\\nthe poor performance of neural systems on this kind of task\\nas of yet. The probability GPT-2 assigns to its generated\\nanswers is well calibrated and GPT-2 has an accuracy of\\n63.1% on the 1% of questions it is most conﬁdent in.

Percentage of test set 8 grams overlapping with training sets.\\n4. Generalization vs Memorization\\nRecent work in computer vision has shown that common im-\\nage datasets contain a non-trivial amount of near-duplicate\\nimages. For instance CIFAR-10 has 3.3% overlap between\\ntrain and test images (Barz & Denzler, 2019). This results in\\nan over-reporting of the generalization performance of ma-\\nchine learning systems. As the size of datasets increases this\\nissue becomes increasingly likely which suggests a similar\\nphenomena could be happening with WebText. Therefore it\\nis important to analyze how much test data also shows up in\\nthe training data.\\nTo study this we created Bloom ﬁlters containing 8-grams\\nof WebText training set tokens. To improve recall, strings\\nwere normalized to contain only lower-cased alphanumeric\\nwords with a single space as a delimiter. The Bloom ﬁlters\\nwere constructed such that the false positive rate is upper\\nbounded by\\n1\\n108 . We further veriﬁed the low false positive\\nrate by generating 1M strings, of which zero were found by\\nthe ﬁlter.\\nThese Bloom ﬁlters let us calculate, given a dataset, the\\npercentage of 8-grams from that dataset that are also found\\nin the WebText training set. Table 6 shows this overlap anal-\\nysis for the test sets of common LM benchmarks. Common\\nLM datasets’ test sets have between 1-6% overlap with Web-\\nText train, with an average of overlap of 3.2%. Somewhat\\nsurprisingly, many datasets have larger overlaps with their\\nown training splits, with an average of 5.9% overlap.\\nOur approach optimizes for recall, and while manual inspec-\\ntion of the overlaps shows many common phrases, there are\\nmany longer matches that are due to duplicated data. This is\\nnot unique to WebText. For instance, we discovered that the\\ntest set of WikiText-103 has an article which is also in the\\ntraining dataset. Since there are only 60 articles in the test\\nset there is at least an overlap of 1.6%.4 Potentially more\\nworryingly, 1BW has an overlap of nearly 13.2% with its\\nown training set according to our procedure.\\nFor the Winograd Schema Challenge, we found only 10\\nschemata which had any 8-gram overlaps with the WebText\\ntraining set. Of these, 2 were spurious matches. Of the\\nremaining 8, only 1 schema appeared in any contexts that\\n4A signiﬁcant portion of additional overlap is due to editors\\nreusing some paragraphs across multiple articles with a shared\\ntheme such as various battles in the Korean War.\\ngave away the answer.\\nFor CoQA, about 15% of documents in the news domain\\nare already in WebText and the model performs about 3\\nF1 better on these. CoQA’s development set metric reports\\nthe average performance over 5 different domains and we\\nmeasure a gain of about 0.5-1.0 F1 due to overlap across the\\nvarious domains. However, no actual training questions or\\nanswers are in WebText since CoQA was released after the\\ncutoff date for links in WebText.\\nOn LAMBADA, the average overlap is 1.2%. GPT-2 per-\\nforms about 2 perplexity better on examples with greater\\nthan 15% overlap. Recalculating metrics when excluding\\nall examples with any overlap shifts results from 8.6 to 8.7\\nperplexity and reduces accuracy from 63.2% to 62.9%. This\\nvery small change in overall results is likely due to only 1\\nin 200 examples having signiﬁcant overlap.\\nOverall, our analysis suggests that data overlap between\\nWebText training data and speciﬁc evaluation datasets pro-\\nvides a small but consistent beneﬁt to reported results. How-\\never, for most datasets we do not notice signiﬁcantly larger\\noverlaps than those already existing between standard train-\\ning and test sets, as Table 6 highlights.\\nUnderstanding and quantifying how highly similar text im-\\npacts performance is an important research question. Better\\nde-duplication techniques such as scalable fuzzy matching\\ncould also help better answer these questions. For now, we\\nrecommend the use of n-gram overlap based de-duplication\\nas an important veriﬁcation step and sanity check during the\\ncreation of training and test splits for new NLP datasets.\\nAnother potential way of determining whether the perfor-\\nmance of WebText LMs is attributable to memorization is\\ninspecting their performance on their own held-out set. As\\nshown in Figure 4, performance on both the training and\\ntest sets of WebText are similar and improve together as\\nmodel size is increased. This suggests even GPT-2 is still\\nunderﬁtting on WebText in many ways.\\nGPT-2 is also able to write news articles about the discovery\\nof talking unicorns.

Casual fabrics are key to pulling off your sneakers in a dressed down menswear outﬁt. I’d even suggest to\\nwear these sneakers with a khaki chino suit or a white linen suit.

These will\\ndeﬁnitely be an issue if you’re trying to work as a casual\\nsneakermaker, and that’s OK but don’t hesitate if you\\nwant to try the lower price versions of their outﬁts!\\nThis version features a very low cut-cut neckline\\n(which is not a bad thing), slightly longer legs, and a pair\\nof long legs to keep things nice. My preferred color of\\ncolor these items are blue-gray (which is my ﬁrst colors,\\nas they are a light white), or black (which is my favorite\\nof my designs).

In 1050 CE\\nthe emperor of Naples, at least partially in characterised by\\na series of wars and invasions from the north-western coast\\nto the western coast of the region (e.g., on the Danube\\nRiver which extended all the way from Gibraltar into the\\nsouth of Spain, but was quickly destroyed on the same\\nday by the Roman army), assumed the title of Emperor\\nof Naples. He made a large contribution over the last few\\ndecades to restore and maintain the empire, the ﬁrst of\\nwhich to the west. His successors were Ferdinand, who\\ntook power from the Papal Throne in 1148, while the ﬁrst\\nimperial successor was King Alfred II of Sweden. The\\nempire was again made one of the few independent states\\nin the European Continent and although no more than 200\\nmillion people lived on its territory during this period the\\npeople had much to say to the Emperor. From 1720 on the\\nMuslims made up half the population of Spain.\\nGPT-2 completion\\nThe Reconquista (literally, ”The return to the country”)\\nof 1092 and 1095 saw the establishment in the Iberian\\npeninsula of a united kingdom of Castile and Aragon in\\nwhich a Muslim dynasty would exist.

Pinky actually attempts to\\nget out in front of Pac-Man. This is accomplished by setting the target 4 tiles ahead of Pac-Man’s current location in\\nthe direction that Pac-Man is travelling. One exception to this is when Pac-Man is traveling up. Due to an overﬂow\\nbug in the code, the calculation includes a left offset equal to the expected up offset.\\nThe use of Pac-Man’s expected position allows the player to exploit the navigation code for Pinky. This was most\\noften seen in situations where Pac-Man and Pinky are in close proximity to each other. For example, if they were\\nheaded toward one another, once they are less than 4 tiles apart, the target tile is now behind Pinky.

So, this a bit of help:\\nFirst of all, the way that fonts are generally handled in Xmonad is through XFT . Xft is the X FreeType\\nInterface library and is a library that handles the actual rendering of fonts in Xmonad/urxvt (Xresources speciﬁes\\na bunch of resources to things that launch under the X window manager. Settings for individual programs are\\nspeciﬁed in Xresources like so: Urxvt.background:background settins here ).\\nAnyway, fonts are set using this syntax in Xresources :\\nurxvt*font:xft:your font name goes here:size=the size of the font goes here,xft:fall-back font 1 goes here\\nSo, thats the most basic part of fonts in urxvt speciﬁed via Xresources.\\nFixing /.ssh/ Permissions in Cygwin\\nIn Cygwin on Windows I found that I could not set the permissions of my /.ssh/ folder to be 0600, as is\\nrequired for ssh to allow you to use keys. The symptom I had was that I no matter what I did, it always modﬁed the\\nowner and the group\\nSmall model completion\\nwas set to /.ssh/ , which was the way things were. This\\ncould not be ﬁxed completely. I found I could make that\\nmuch more workable with just typing the username with\\nyour mouse then trying to set permissions to be ”0600”\\nfor the group, which is what my system is now conﬁgured\\nto do.\\nHowever, as of Cygwin 7 on Linux I have found\\nthat doing so is now ”unnecessary” for my system! I also\\ninstalled a package called chroot. It does that by allowing\\nyou to install/upgrade to your system directory.\\nSo, as of Windows 8 and up, installing that can re-\\nquire chroot, so I tried and tried and found that it wasn’t\\nso bad when installing the package on Linux and then\\nuninstalling it. As of my last write-up on Cygwin, the\\nscript just does its job (the sudo commands do the rest), if\\nyou try it you will have to log the change.\\nIf that wasn’t confusing enough, this is what I tried and\\njust went back to my /.ssh/ directory and the chroot script.\\nI found I was ﬁnally running out of permissions (because\\ni forgot to create a symlink to ssh from the ﬁle system and\\nGPT-2 completion\\n, making these ﬁles read-only. I tried just starting ssh\\nand using a program like passwd which modiﬁes the\\nowner/group to 0644 permissions, but it didn’t work.
